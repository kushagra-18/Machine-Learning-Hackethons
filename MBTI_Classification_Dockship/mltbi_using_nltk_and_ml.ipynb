              "' yep yep yep especially the last one yep agree yep sounds like me funny to have your personality explained so simply by someone else someone wrote that in thread here and thought it was great quote was wondering how do you use your empathy and intuition in your everyday life to effectively manage people or handle oh gosh yes never knew this was an infp trait think you re right it can make us vulnerable to suggestion understand your point but also realize that feeling these feelings of others is not something which is always voluntary it not something you consciously seek out it just happens that you get hit nail on head happy think infps are cerebral they tend to think through things before speaking they try to connect various thoughts and ideas in way that makes sense to them before sharing it with anyone so yes when m stressed and feeling overwhelmed in these instances my irrational mind takes over and races mile an minute with the most crazy thoughts when m stressed in this mode my mind goes so m finding that it sometimes little difficult to quiet the mind and maintain sense of calm actively find new strategies to help me regain and maintain feeling of separateness or the following are my favorites so far attraction doesn always mean someone is good or right fit and yeah relationship skills are key if partners don listen or respect each other across those generational gaps then it will answered this in another part of the forum but ll add my opinion here happy used to idealize the younger older relationship and really wanted to be in that kind of relationship until i admit that on many occasions have read little too much into someone facial expressions and found myself confirming biases than truly being impartial or objective about what was seeing or you use your lunch time at work to catch up on reading or look out the window of the cafe or cafeteria wondering what others things you love to be doing yes guilty of this seeing or reading things in people facial expressions underlying feelings or vibes which scream out at me while the person and everyone else thinks it below the surface or to support what others have said yes usually if someone regardless of type discuss an issue by talking it through with us then it probably helps they tend to feel accepted and comfortable sometimes it makes me think m paranoid and just seeing things which admit can be possibility unsure but it does make me feel little awesome to know that can pick up on things others may think the infp is just reacting to your strong belief that you are right because you believe you are more logical or objective because of your they are responding to your assumption that not sure if this is an infp thing or an nf thing but do you notice subtle differences in meaning when observing or communicating with people do you find that you can take something apart and break how do you feel when someone confides in you feels good that someone feels they can trust me with that info and feels good to know they think can be that person who can handle their crap yep ll lay around for long period of time doing nothing then suddenly get this surge of energy and then try to do many things in the evening or at night things should have done earlier in my favorites dry love should never be just many splendored thing it should be many treasured thing potayto potaaato tomayto tomato let just call the whole thing vegetable slop yep yep yep sooo true found out while back that this is called catastrophizing and do it lot it almost like second nature agree one sided relationships are not worth it in the long run and clearly aren fair to the partner who invests quite bit sometimes at great cost without receiving very much in return yes it our way of connecting with our fi since we sometimes have to keep it tucked away in the shadows in our day to day lives it our time to breathe or exhale seeming all business and serious usually does it sometimes but unfortunately they also can make people think something is wrong and want to talk to me even more so maybe that doesn work so introversion is that time for me to just be without trying too hard to be something else being around people makes me self conscious and consequently other directed often act and behave in ways leoni so much of what you ve said clicks with me don like being in fish bowl or being the center of attention work in small office right now and like it it more relaxed like the sometimes am not sure what works until meet someone it sometimes the qualities of the individual which attracts you rather than particular set of qualities for example the last person this pls stop reading my mind laughing seriously this is very true though thought it was just me yes do it but am also realizing how uncomfortable it can be for the person being observed in this way when m not sure of someone and m still figuring them out tend to observe them quite if you re good french teacher that good we need more of those both and none at all sometimes want to hide myself to protect it from the abuses of the world or protect the world from me laughing and sometimes want to seek which for me means allowing am very guarded as result of the experiences ve had over the years don really think of people the way once did as result of these perceptions it tiring fighting these perceptions yeah and they also believe that if you dislike and avoid conflict that you re unable to understand the true nature of the world or not capable of seeing the world as it is they assume that being one thing is the belief that certain qualities give the impression of being childlike such as shyness and not expressing certainty when giving your opinions or not stating your opinions decidedly agree am not sure would dislike the formal or strict aspects since have little of that in me because of how grew up but d probably be more into the art stuff although m not the when you re the reluctant victim of an ongoing double standard which says it ok if someone else is upset and expresses it but it not ok for you if you express that you re annoyed or bothered when you try to conform and fit in as much as you can but yet still feel and seem like sore thumb sticking out when you constantly have to edit yourself to make point only to realize that you re sacrificing your own right to speak your views because you re too worried about what others may feel or think liked french and the language but was always worried about not getting tenses and grammar right or perfect think if could have overcome that fear maybe d be at least be fluent by now yep that arrogance would turn me off this is probably one of the main reasons ve always liked france or the idea of it very bohemian think it the idea of more slow paced life where you enjoy the moment rather than yes for some reason people tell me personal stuff including their entire life story telling me things they would never tell anyone else and barely know them well am not sure it a very beautiful poems you ve said what many have felt and hope one day to hear from the one they love someday happy yeah not fan of fighting to get my way never works in the end after ve exerted an enormous amount of energy still rarely get what is needed so ve given up asserting or '"

              "[' so true said earlier that my face was very expressive and it got me into trouble the real reason it most often gets me into trouble is because my faces are involuntary responses to internal dear enfj think finally figured out why your sudden turn from being friend who could talk about anything with to person who wants to pretend we re just casual acquaintances bothers me so have decent tolerance for certain kinds of pain cuts needles etc can handle pain mixed with pressure though had so many people tell me that because of the drugs epidural my husband and are infp estj too it so rare to come across that really interesting my mom is isfj thought she was an esfj for so long because of all the insane emotional guilt trips yeah two of the three people who recently referred to me as intimidating have witnessed me being passionate about something and also my emotional intensity think the other one might just be infp indigo but that probably doesn count so purple misconceptions have opinions about trivial things that am concealing from other people truth when have an opinion that am not concealing from myself you ll know it it probably this is really interesting don know too many people who feel this way about their values being personal and their religious beliefs feel the same way but articulating it to people who yeah think that when my values are crossed and get angry and vicious and somehow simultaneously passionate and fiery and cold might be bit intimidating or you know utterly that the same reason that didn sleep last night laughing thinking in terms of being 4 then yeah can see being intimidating m super intimidated by other 4s and even understand this happens to me constantly think with lot of people the introversion extroversion thing might play big role m scared of other introverts heck m scared of other for real crime hilarious nope m pretty much daydreaming about scenarios where people notice care about me rather than forget that exist do think the zoning out daydreaming thing think the english teacher thing is so funny because had an english teacher tell me the opposite that she could read me like book by my facial expressions the thing is often do zone out have so many involuntary facial expressions they used to get me in trouble when was kid because my face was giving away my true emotions in very animated way without my even knowing it despite being the exact stereotype of the fluffy emotional cute dreamy infp and despite being the type of person that goes out of her way to be self deprecatingly funny and make other people feel just got new job and everyone there is shocked to discover that have children am 30 but everyone there independently of one another has thought that was 22 or 23 think it yes m usually so quirky sweet pacifistic and self effacing but if am made aware of injustice or someone harming someone else or someone doing something believe is wrong snap ll have been married inexplicably to an estj for eight years don tend to be attracted to sj types at first but it turns out that need the to balance my extreme ness have lot of my cat known as mean kitty to my friends is super diabolical intj socially 23 spiritually 101 mentally intellectually 45 physically 70 emotionally psychologically 6 pisces and m such pisces but that probably completely coincidental my estj husband is also pisces if that tells you anything got 80 100 but the page that shows your score out of 100 only seems to show your score for one section of the entire test if you look into the sample of the full report it shows your score out only when m right wink was just thinking exactly the same thing myself my 4 might make me very jealous of my unique nature on the other hand m not really hesitant to type people as type 4 maybe because that actually have the opposite problem have trouble seeing anyone else as an infp readily type people as pretty much anything else that seems to apply but can quite put anyone else into the thanks feel like the mismatched shoes are an accurate representation of who am for better or worse would have left the house that way too if my 5 year old hadn pointed it out to me noble 1 socratic 4 reflective 5 candidate love that it suggests that think can solve any problem by talking about it long enough it right do infp 4w5 so sx 4 9 5 dear sj new bosses and coworkers you are scaring me to death sincerely your extremely nf new hire really don like to write it was always what was best at in school people have always said that your gift you should be writer it certainly is what comes most easily but loathe dear istj daughter don think ll ever understand you and can empathize with almost anyone wish knew why you seem to be so caught up in anxious about the trivial mundane details of m was the only in my family growing up and m the only in my family now think ve got enough to go around my family dad xstp mom isfj me infp sister esfp me infp ve been noticing how awful this is for me recently as ve started new job take things that should be simple to learn by the dictates of common sense and complicate them so much in my dear enfj friend really don regret one minute of the time that we spent letting you into our home lives listening and being there for you when you went through some really awful times please know that you aren alone feel this way so often sometimes to extremes for extended periods of time feel dependent self doubting advice seeking rejecting etc know it agree really like the enfj screenplay writing and acting choice that seems to fit all of the enfjs know the enfps are less likely to engage in solitary endeavors although it been known this exactly they re super personal or else really forced and awkward need them from my husband like them from my kids feel smothered by them from my mother wish could get few from my dear estj husband yes you probably are better person than me because you can work 80 hour weeks without complaining while come home weeping every day from my part time job it not like i was very lucky in that my high school was huge enough that there was basically niche for everyone even the strangest of us had group of friends in theater and other activities that were ve always heard that it was the people with flaws similar to your own that were supposed to bother you the most but this is never the case for me always find that empathize with the people 30 but really blend between 3 and 83 think that this is actually why thought that was intp rather than infp for while my family had lot of emoting going on and because tended to be less sentimental than they were empathetic compassionate anxious self loathing adorable not my favorite actually but think that how come across when m trying to compensate for my goofy awkwardness and make everyone my daughter is an tj we re thinking but we could be wrong when she was toddler she displayed significant savant behaviors and seemed oblivious to social cues needless to say we if were ruler of the world would immediately find way to stop being ruler of the world it sounds just awful terrifying corrupting frightening futile etc no thank you ll find the s are most likely to annoy me with their irritating attention to the mundane like them but their insistence on paying attention to their surroundings at the expense of for example having so completely relate to this and in the extremely rare case when actually do something create something say something start something almost instantly doubt myself and immediately regret wow just did this exact thing recently with friendship had to physically stop myself from calling the person because felt had analyzed what went wrong for months and wanted to discuss wish could say desire to live but it turns out that live defensively so guess mostly m trying to avoid death or at least suffering never feared death until had kids though the very infp unfriendly suburb in michigan not so happy here assume the worst about everything especially social interactions and my role in them have tendency to become so consumed in fantasy that am disappointed bored with reality am ',\n",

              " ' yeah realize that now the trio mugen estp clear usage of se ti sometimes has moments of fe jin most likely an istj however d be willing to entertain him being an intj although he seems more si te apparently there someone else writing the script he just says it and makes the jokes on that note he probably an entp okay so just rewatched the series after four years and here my new verdict masaomi kida esfp mikado infx anri sonohara infj mika harima exfx leaning towards enfp seiji yagiri mainly because he voiced by spike spiegel and mugen steve blum also totally agree of course let start with mako firstly his intuition is off the charts which was highlighted in season 2 when he caught onto varrick entp before anyone else did also mako never struck me aang enfp katara isfj sokka entp toph xstp zuko infp iroh enfj suki isfj mai istj ty lee esfp azula entj masaomi kida exfp leaning towards esfp mikado isfj anri sonohara isfp or infj mika harima who knows seiji yagiri istj namie yagiri intj izaya orihara entp shizuo dear intjs and entps you re both everything that want to be in life sincerely intp dear isfp you re annoying sincerely intp don know if this applies to most of you but after few relationships now or even budding ones m starting to realize that m romantically incompatible with most it seems like in each feel like quite lot of people who aren intps forget the bolded part if with someone respond in my mind and hold the conversation with their replies in my head but sometimes forget that it not actually going down like that mother hen is this joke clerks dante infp randal istp veronica esfj caitlin esfp jay estp silent bob intp mallrats brodie estp silent bob is an intp jay is an esxp since he seems like an esfp in jay and silent bob strike back but in all of the other view askew productions he seems like an estp by this point m between istj or infp the whole conceal don feel bit seems something like an unhealthy fi dom could do but m leaning towards istj due to heavy use of si when they tell you by secretly encoding the message into their texts _______________________________________________ frankly don believe that john milton should be viewed as an ethical just myth not even subtle he definitely wants to hit it yeah but long distance where is he from he sounds xntp in all seriousness my si is quite developed but my fe needs work for example sometimes when m debating ll be shouting kind of not full on shouting but starting to shout clearly pissed underdeveloped intps just need to calm the fuck down as an underdeveloped intp approve this message don quite believe that it my place to measure the value of others however in all honesty it cannot be helped mostly by the qualities that we have deemed are worthy prefer those who insects typing myself infatuation chrono ixxp although he can be typed very accurately due to his lack of dialogue that bit of information reveals that he an introvert don believe that he a either chrono seems to be natsu esfp lucy enfp gray istp erza istj happy esfp wendy isfj carla istj gajeel istp juvia enfp or isfp think nina is definitely an fp my guess is probably xsfp mugen estp definitely mugen is clearly an se dom from the start fuu enfp would be my main guess jin ixtj while has more of an istj vibe to me he very intuitive looking at it he seems considered eva being an intj same with river being an infp typed river as an isfp mainly because of her artistic eye as for eva actually think you re right she probably an intj what eva rosalene intj neil watts xntp someone on typology central typed him as an intp could definitely see it but he seems bit extroverted to me so m leaning towards entp johnny not by comparing their introversion and extroversion but by which dominant function they use in other words how faye uses se ti then how spike uses ti se agree with spike and faye can also see why you say that about jet but he seems bit te to me what m really curious about is why you think that vicious is an also about ed and julia as completely agree your statement is especially illustrated by contrasting spike and faye when you look at how the two differ you can see that spike is an ti dom where faye is an se dom while okay so this is my new overall typing spike istp jet istj faye estp was talking with my sister about it who is an estp and she said that she used to be like faye when she was so think you may have been right about gren he some ixfp although as for spike being an introvert in one of the episodes guy accuses spike of not talking much but spike simply retorts scott isfp stiles entp allison infj derek isxp jackson estj lydia entj no never said introversion was why he in the past at least m pretty sure that didn it just seems like you re typing by letters instead of functions no se dom would be that stuck in the yeah wondered about that too he didn really give me fe ti vibe though color same after watching through the series repeatedly it seems that estp is her shadow when that could be because he uses se as his second function spike doesn really seem like an se dom seeing that he still stuck in the past also he doesn quite seem like an inferior ni either spike istp jet black istj faye don know when first started watching cowboy bebop thought faye was an estp for sure after watching the series many times faye is in her shadow initially was intrigued by the idea perhaps the reason that it bothers me is because grew up thinking otherwise ah so tell me if got this right 0 999 is supposed to represent an m not so sure that it does after all infinity is number greater than any assignable quantity or countable number 0 999 wouldn be greater than infinity although d love for you to remember talking about

i battling with wether or not should reply to your answers and ve decided that should you re being quite blunt and insensitive about this ve been with this man for 7 years with both oh have many times many many many times why do you think m in relationship only to change him never said that my question was if it might be possible for an entj to become more in touch thanks yeah it clear that we cope very differently with our problems and respect that my problem is that he quickly gets rude as soon as express that feel sad or anxious because he feels as an enfp often feel that it hard to get the emotional support need from my entj partner when start talking about anxiety or express sadness over lost family member he tends to get yeah can definetely relate to the surge and desire for something else something more anything different and new usually grab glass of wine satisfy my self loathing with cigarette and haha kill em with kindness do that too but don think that being neccessarily means that you have to be sympathetic and compassionate it just means that your actions are largely based on your emotions and not on logical conclusion write poems lyrics and short stories so don sit for very long to write usually get struck by inspiration and start writing what seems to be pouring out of my pen sorry if that sounds always get pangs of anxiety after shopping spree so buy clothes and make up very rarely usually get stuff like that for xmas or as birthday present i kind of feel like it a waste of haha this is actually worse than me i think it a ten out of ten on the messiness scale have clothes lying everywhere books and study material on the floor labcoats on the kitchen floor clothes stuffed into my bathroom no i focus on how they make me feel like clothes to be comfortable rather than trendy for example and can be bothered to put on make up on weekday much rather sleep another half hour haha cool it a small world you may very well be right yes certainly but that doesn make it less painful thank you your analysis is probably head on it seems like many intraverts feel misunderstood in family full of extraverts and it makes me sad mean we love her value her and ofcourse we want wow this is eerie how similair this sounds to our situation we really have tried to listen to her show her that we mean well and that we just want to be part of her life but she just cut us off yeah that my fear she has tendencies to get involved with men who wants to save her and she wants to be saved by them and then she kind of abandons her own ideas and values for his maybe it thank you that is comforting to hear really miss her okay thanks for your respons she in her mid twenties but we went through some tough shit during our childhood and think her inability to cope with it made her regress in some aspects tried hi have sister who is an infj she severed all bonds with our family due to reasons we can comprehend after meeting this other infj and moved to his country where they are now living in what no way how come yes do absolutely but that insecurity often motivates me even more these days makes me want to prove to myself and to others that m capable so run in head first it doesn always work brno where in europe are you from m from sweden currently living in the czech republic raised in england during the first part of my childhood would like to visit japan for the food and subculture and the galapagos islands and hi m just starting to work on my diploma thesis where we will modify rabies virus transcribe and translate the rabies rna and then incert cdna into coli plasmids to produce viral products then wish for something but m not sure what different time different place can feel it in my gut the faces the places the trips and the treats ve walked these streets again and again was never like your daughter frankly think she sounds horribly rude my parents would have slapped that behaviour out of me if ever talked to them in that way do get offended because you think the completely destroyed her argument part might be why she got upset she might have thought that you could playfully debate this particular topic and felt run over when you bulldozered whaaaaat have you released an ep what kind of music do you make can listen during boring lecture my mind leaves the conversation instantly if someone asks me about what the lecturer just said just have to tell them dude m not even here ve found that cooking and drinking beer while listening to music makes me feel better after while start dancing around having an awesome time alone in my kitchen also watching i getting feeling that you re trying to tell me that what experienced actually was my fault and that was projecting my feelings on my mother told my story in balanced and mature way god yes seem to go between extremes too ve been like an infp for long time now never quite got out of long depression in my teens but m starting to feel lot better now getting in had similair relationship to my now boyfriend entj and just flat out told him that had feelings for him and that wanted to be with him took him week to think about it and then long have an esfj mother and it was hard growing up she exploded over what she percieved as an attitude and it would scare the shit out of me because didn even know what was having an hear that many enfps experience it hard to decide on job and enjoy it but m not like that at all just decided that would become vet and just decided that would finish vet school don think so at all my experience is that they love to debate and quarrel and respects you when their point of view is challanged by good argument but loyalty yes indeed very important have several close infp friends and also my father is infp and we have so much fun together think we attract each other great minds think alike love infps male 70 8 100 female 60 5 100 androgenous 65 8 100 but would just like to add that this is perpetuating the gender rules for men and women who is to say what is more masculine and what is dear certain esfp stop trying to control everyone and stop trying to impose your values on everyone don want to do yoga it pisses me off and know meat used to be animals but so was that yeah ve been jumping from relationship to relationship since like forever have no patience at all it important for me to connect to someone to feel close to someone guess that another wow you sound like an amazing parent wrote some stuff but changed my mind so chose to remove it since couldn delete the entire thing ve suffered from periods of

think he may have isfp preferences used to think he was j but now think me too when people ask me about my religious beliefs explain that m panentheistic and describe it but it always goes right over their heads which is really annoying m glad met another very true m pretty sure nicki minaj has estp preferences ve seen an interview of her and she used just as much se as the other esxps know after while you can just tell when someone uses dominant eminem seems like thinker because he consciously tries not to show his emotions because he afraid of appearing vulnerable he definitely an isfp no question about it istps use fe which he definitely has nf values so he probably belongs in that temperament furthermore he seems pretty introverted so d go with infx he has tremendous amount of vision in some of his songs so haha loved it they re my favorite movies and our depth comes with price you ne users have much broader and more open perspective you also get to use your dominant function in the outer don know if other ni users think this way but this is the best way can explain my normal train of thought ll be singing something in my head while vaguely visualize someone singing it sorry to hear that it must have been tough couldn have said it better myself you seem to use good amount of ti if you know you re introverted perhaps you could check out istp intp isfj and infj type descriptions to see which one fits you better yes think of it as an internal map of facts ideas beliefs and concepts that looks pretty much like what you drew with each piece of information as one of the dots it almost impossible to explain know what it is in my head but when try to talk about it the words m saying just make no sense that me exactly just had an experience with that single philosophy class took in college forced me to change my entire worldview was sad and confused for months before was finally think read somewhere that having strong feeling that turns out to be right is common in both isfjs and infjs but it comes from fi for us fi is our 6th most preferred function although it i glad you say that didn like lady gaga music until really payed attention to her lyrics looking at what lay beneath the surface of what she was saying after that thought the word true but guess for an isfp the focus is more on the senses and not on the metaphor itself the metaphor is used to assist in creating the image instead of few images memories being the interesting didn know that thank you for telling me he always struck me as using most of his cognitive functions well which makes his type preferences harder to deduce ll have to think jung referred to people by their dominant function while mbti would specify the difference between an esfp and an estp jung would call them both extraverted sensing types thus by calling so you are saying that jung believed the dominant function to be much more significant to person personality than the auxiliary and tertiary and that the auxiliary and tertiary functions were in didn know that actually maybe he meant that he ended up orienting himself towards sensation for his profession think saw somewhere that he considered the study of psychology to require an jung said he was an int if he was wrong about his own type then what reason would we have to believe any of his theories to be true entp just to be sure though read up on temperaments if you identify more with the theorist nt temperament than the catalyst nf temperament then that pretty much sets it in stone that definitely true of her your explanation making me lean more towards esfp now though but ll have to think about it more thanks for the imput understand the are few people in general on this forum who try to pick on sensors way too much just because someone doesn have your same personality preferences doesn mean that you can i having some trouble typing my emotionally unstable friend m having lots of trouble finding out what type best fits one of my best friends she seems to be more of an estp than an esfp m not jealous at all and m also not trying to say that intjs are necessarilly more selfish than other types they just appear that way because of tertiary fi everybody is little selfish in m the same way very introverted but often in need of companionship get so overstimulated around others sometimes that spend lot of time in my room but that prevents me from going out apologize if someone already said this as didn read most of the comments here intjs have tertiary fi which like all tertiary functions is applied narcissistically and in limited figure out which interaction style you use that should set it in stone for you you almost certainly have istj preferences m sure of it your responses to questions on this forum point to te fi not fe ti me too love hearing what other people have to say about anything but it no more black and white than anything else about type theory when you define yourself based on type you define have no idea either but there nothing wrong with it pinkrasputin just doesn like directive speech directive speech is used when you order people to do things that need to be done though hate to be rude but do you think you might have istj preferences istjs use mostly directing while isfjs use mostly informing honestly m still not sure of my type preferences could see infjs use directing not informing so maybe you use directing without even realizing it true she usually means the effect of their actions when she says big picture now m not sure again about her type because just read about interaction styles in depth particulary the think you misinterpreted what said was saying the same thing as you that the meaning is central for infps whereas the sensory detail backed by metaphor is what isfps use se ni love isfp know the feeling think it because we re smart and use big words some people equate that with having superior attitude trust me people have said the same about me when realized people the singer of linkin park is definitely fi dom m pretty sure he an infp brandon flowers lead singer of the killers is most likely an infp think for most infps the meaning of the song is more important than the image if that makes sense so songs written by an no problem it so interesting and personally surprising to me that if something intolerant cruel was said that you would not necessarily say anything about it but be angry about ted infj robin istp lily esfp marshall enfp barney enxp yea know that seems like pretty annoying situation at least you re at college now and have some more breathing room as understand it having extraverted feeling fe means that you to some extent take on as your own the values and needs of group assuming that is correct and if not d love to hear from keirsey didnt create the temperament model based on cognitive functions but on observed similarities in their life goals and motivations also fe especially coupled with ni will challenge the figured that coming up with alternate explanations would be more enjoyable for an thus figured they stick with the search for an alternate explanation longer in general of course yeah me too usually get along well with isfjs and we can seem the same on the outside but our inner beliefs and values are often so different that it hard for us to agree on anything are judgers just not receptive to people perceptions then are all judgers inflexible and not changeable bono is an enfj for the following reasons he passionate about his visions for world think sensors are in general more

this affects life expectancy or not is beyond me as it depends on how elusive an entp is elusive entps ve been questioning on if have add or not wouldn say have the type with super high energy all the time d say that pretty well balanced for me but more of the type with the ohhhhhh man question authority and why do we do the things we do on freaking daily basis like today when as talking to my newswriting teacher and asked why they write leads certain this sounds lot like me it good to know wasn the only unhappy introverted entp who didn date etc high five heyheyhey so was thinking about dyeing my hair possibly dark blue it would be something that differentiates me from the crowd and it look cool too this summer just think ve turned into college oh yes we re all mad there 8d enjoy the large amounts of posts interesting topics and general activity in this forum it just keeps going and going and going not infp but saw someone was wondering about other types and if they re seen as weird and yeah definitely am to the point where rarely talk to the people at my work because just find hate the phone d much rather talk to someone in person or through mail once begin talking to someone know on the phone can become very chatty but m talking more along the lines of donna noble from doctor who okay so think it would work if trade my soul for everything that would mean that after the trade the everything would include my soul and the guy sold it to so d end up with there an entj know that ve never seen cry but once she told me about her day and that she went back to her room and cried over someone taking her idea that she had been growing and planning an infj know wanted to be psychologist that deals with teenagers something about how they re the most in need of guidence which makes sense ve been raised as christian estj mom drilled it in infp dad as well but now m questioning my beliefs like crazy it just so hard to shake off when ve been living with it my entire life plan sometimes and like you rarely follow through with them yeahhh you re still entp wink my entj friend follows through with her plans every time and keeps planner to make sure doooo although there are some people who think m the funniest person in the universe those people are most likely the least sensitive people on the globe god d love to use that idiom super shy was pushed to be an istj just didn know myself all that well so glad m beyond all that m just so free everything hm would that even work my mind is spinning just thinking about it get along well with nfs usually nfjs but recently found an xnfp and she awesome too but ve never been with one had an infj as roomie that was fun got her into new things and off crazy sometimes but more often than not unique weird and quirky have been used take em as compliments that means m different from the general masses my personal experience we re magnetic and people tend to come together through us we introduce new things into the world and everyone else who already magnetized to us finds something they never was thinking more along the lines of actually giving an entp to someone for their birthday but that works too 8d do make amazing cards that leave people laughing their asses off yes it embarrassing but ve seen psychologist in the past and she says it necessary for most people and m trying to work that into my set of principles so don feel like leadership medium ll try to get away with not leading since it too much work most of the time but if others are incapable ll step up to the plate and whack home run also if m m often called funny quirky and just fun to be around we make great gifts for birthdays 8d jumps into giftbox hey just figured out m entp after about month of researching intp no more man although they are very similar due to functions anyway agree with ray here tease people and it thanks for making this thread op m currently trying to decide if m intp or entp as well and lot of the entp discussions on this board really do relate to me especially since entps are more ha no worries see the merit in your remark and m not about to go all sensitive on you nor will lie on something think can agree with due to past experiences pfft m aware tongue there are certainly times where say things that mirror the entp and get sometimes hilarious reactions and other times when keep things to myself to avoid getting smug egotistical attitude very m starting to wonder if m an entp honestly random witty crap shoots out from my mouth at the speed of light and m joking well most of the time do wonder if people take it the nekotabi nozomu is definitely super negative infp fuuka could be xnfp leaning more towards enfp people talking about yuki nagato she definitely an intx

much much more prone to emotional outbursts this includes sadness eh toss the insult you re stupid around in so many different scenarios that it doesn seem like it really means anything more like it

even know in the beginning we had to walk around and hug everyone at first it felt so uncomfortable because you are difficult person to pierce through would like to add that sports and meditation can

              " ' oh gosh it okay really love you don have to apologize it not so bad anymore we re all grown and mature enough to deal with what happened to us as just another stage of our lives that we ve see think that where your emotional freedom of sorts might come from excusing the fact that from what you ve told me you seem to have been naturally emotionally stable kind of person you re so m not going to delve into my own backstory m not all that keen on sharing it but can say that as terribly useless as this might sound understand to some extent where you re coming see mean d much rather admit to someone having the desire to be different or special based on what natural quirks that they posses what gets me is the one that actively spend time telling oops think we really took care of that hijacking thing for you sorry about that but would think that can be said for lot of intp from what ve seen the statement am right is not figured as much for the most part but do think that when both parties are lacking in the information department being cocky might give you the upper hand in making it seem like you know your know m absolutely useless with finishing anything at all the amount of unfinished notes and ideas that ve hoarded are off the charts my humble thing is just really gr8 facade m secretly cocky as all hell you just wait and see honest to goodness though don think ll ever be fully convinced of my type for some d like to hope m not mean come on we have to have at least handful of 15 year olds milling about somewhere don know m just waiting for the 19 to hit literally have never been so you be surprised at how often being 18 gets me scoffed at my opinion tends to hold little to no weight but that cool don really mind per say unless m around group of really m really fond that this thread turned into height age instead of just height save for the fact that m only slightly embarrassed by my youth well the thing about smoking with me is that understand why most people think it useless which it kind of is won argue it it that classic case of thought it looked cool still think it mumbles incoherent noises you and that and this entire intp community are way nicer than you should be freaking out little how can say thanks creatively ve had real long time polishing my people smile so yeah m rarely without grin in pictures or with others so thank you screams gosh thank you ahh sorry wow okay don do very well taking compliments from pretty girls alright okay surprisingly enough smile in all my photos tend to look hecka sociable 75589 know that feeling most of the time but sometimes wow that loss of control is just intoxicating no pun intended alternatively why don get drunk often some sort of dependency is just bound m not all that great at staying on topic when speak mean m powerful speaker but d definitely be sacrificing my grade if did talking versus paper wow more like my dream okay but challenge you on the cleavage front being girl gives me practically unlimited rights to stare at other girls boobs as much as like so there and that i know christ smokes are so much money quit kind of for the time being at least till find part time and can legally buy them on my own huh avoid getting drunk too am allowed to know but ugh there something about staring at pages after pages of something you ve written and just kind of confirming it real words are so ephemeral even when recorded but when write you may have won the battle etc etc and rude m totally not even that short maintain good average thank you very much d rather not be like 50000 ft tall so was just curious about how many intp participate in recreational drugs man hate that term so in more casual words how many intp smoke weed or get drunk or do miscellaneous other lies and slander air can be quite stubborn too especially when worked up into tizzy or something didn pick air in regards to flow picked it because of its moldability and while that might sound the ll drink to that woah now friend that never boring topic cheers to you dystopias are some of the most creative things out there know that feeling don think ve ever wow okay so m noticing lot of intp enjoy writing and so on so was wondering what your genre is it diary writing romance sci fi horror journalism mean as funny as it sitting at about 5 5 fortunately think m just about done growing though find it little bit hilarious that someone out there tried to compile research on height in correlation to actually really love how ecclectic the answers ended up this time almost every choice landing at least one intp and it also great that everyone had different word to describe themselves this is actually devastatingly true which bothers me more than m willing to admit well as much as it sucks am so fixated on the concept of trying not to be unique or different it m actually fairly good with complainers it can be hard sometimes even when you realize that you re not allowed to offer set list of solutions to problems they might have guess practice has do agree with the concerned and willing if not eager to help what gets me though is the judgmental bit think it less about not being judgmental and more about the fact that m just not okay while m not disagreeing with you can get over my base irrationality that the number of sides makes me uncomfortable practical fine enjoyable not so much guess but mean it doesn happen with enough frequency that it gets tiring personality issues generally don come up in my day to day conversations unfortunately and while agree with well suppose that when make friendships always have the underlying knowledge that at some point or another it will come to an end either they will leave or will can get very seriously need you to tell me why on earth triangle of all things would be practical haha suppose that might be the intp in me haha hate staying quiet when someone hasn understood something properly misinformation makes me slightly anxious yes it the keeping friends usually struggle with m starting to attribute it to my level of involvement and interest considering lose interest in things after set amount of time not woah so m noticing lot of people going off on the fact the intp females are really shy or don leave their houses etc being an introvert does not automatically make you socially handicapped i ll admit was definitely square m an absolute sucker for hard lines almost picked circle in correlation to the ensō and what it means to me but angles get me every time and there getting to see what others have answered is neat think it just further proves the point that not all people of the same type are exactly the same intp are so diverse it kind of little well to be honest it mostly family that gets my vote of obligation friends are little bit iffier lots of them assuming that need to be 100 committed to being their friend without getting well fair enough but suppose my obligation falls more under the category of respect and convenience it a lot simpler to keep in contact with my family than face the inevitable disdain and communication out of obligation isn always bad thing in my opinion you never know when that relationship might be conducive to some goal you ve set mean sure it might not be fun but in yes ve had ten or so year friendship that came to rather abrupt end and was almost shocked at my lack of sadness over the matter thought it would mean more to me considering we were okay so ve had bit of experience with people finding out m an intp and then proceeding to ask me theoretical questions about how d react in an emotion situation in contrast to how normal it almost unfortunate but it true intp aren the best kind of people to have around the workplace and during job interview your strongest skill set might just be your ability to lie and mean just because don care doesn mean can feel just figure there so many people that don see difference between those two concepts it always makes me feel like have to explain okay so they said should totally make one of these so m following through for once think m supposed to list my type and talk about myself or something but m kinda stumped on the whole so ve been doing shit ton of sniffing around intp personality stereotypes and m finding lot of people claiming not to have emotions or are just plain sociopaths and mean besides that ',\n",

that this feeling was just part of growing up so this month ll be done with college and wanted to ask you guys something m looking for something meaningful to do can start working pretty much any time want but before that d like from my understanding friendship isn about you making them like you it about group who enjoys time spent together just be yourself if people don like the genuine you too bad if they do agree with the fact that my example is unrealistic but think you re pretty narrow minded when you say the following when you read the rest of the thread you can see that some people reach i second that ahah consider myself ambitious want to get meaningful job where can help people and do good but that ambition is limited to my own surroundings want the person love with me family can appreciate someone passion for subject but if have no interest for the subject probably won pay very close hear to what he has to say don really value raw knowledge as i can be with you on this one ve dated girls that everyone would find hot and girls that everyone found ugly in the end think you just got statistic ed average girls are the girls you meet never really eat for breakfast when was in college d often have 3 hour classes starting at 8am d be stuck in room with 25 strangers and my stomach would be sing whole concerto the train yourself by telling girls you don care about that you like them as joke say friend is angry at you try telling that friend something along the lines of oh come on don you today had to explain to my 45 yo father that some people are introverted that not everyone enjoys going out and social interaction as much as he does sigh get what you mean get you can find quite few threads in our subjection covering the subject of what attracts male enfp in depth as summary d say that we are attracted to open minded laid back honest and what kind of woman acts really shy in real life but almost tells you she in love online so strange but guess it wouldn be fun if men and women could easily read each other never think someone is beyond is redemption but do leave people who annoy me it more of on the spot than what you ve done kinda deal oh yeah love doing that love watching how people react to given event watching how it unfolds for each person don use that information in order to juge peopledecide wether can trust don really care m never in hurry don think could actually care enough to react ve met lot of people who would type as nts and sts who thought like that d look into my type bit more if was you just my advice like navy way more

to or not as long as you re happy right what holding you back from settling down anyway she cute heyyyyyyyyyyyyy congratulations go with the blessings and best whishes of random internet people went little too far when said it was rubbish guess was just trying to say that since there is no broad consensus unified theory and lack the knowledge to objectively make my choices don know as much as enjoy mbti and functions ve come to the conclusion that the whole classification is rubbish anyway people don agree on what is right and ve got close to no knowledge well wouldn rule out the possibility that one of us is mistyped but yeah it never been an issue for me do you know the sun trick always use that for directions sun rises in the east in don think it an enfp trait like to think

esfj is more feminine the estp more out for trying new styles etc enfjs esfps enfps and esfjs are the ones have experienced to be very popular usually liked enfp may be the least popular among these though infps rarely reject other people opinions if they disagree they ll most likely not say anything act like bullied child ve taken it tons of times and the results has been from intp to infj but m

in real life talks on the phone her voice completely changes into soft bumblebee intp love listening to your ideas you make me silent every time you talk about how you see the world ok so my dad an

periods in my life due to various reasons one of these periods went dangerously close to the definition of burnout ve found in scientific literature due to yes tend to do this lot although have learnt to control myself or at least try do it mainly when discussion sparkles new ideas but as wealldie said before generally remember many things annoy me but the following really piss me off people who are both incompetent and arrogant don like arrogant people but if they re good at what they do can at least live don enjoy rehearsing conversations of personal nature because then get bored when they actually take place it as if silenced the inner voice to enjoy the unexpected but have always queenofleaves guess my reaction would depend on whether think that the insult accusation deserves reply independent of my relationship with those who defended me you know it funny gandalf of course huge lotr fan here btw yes do not often fight using all my energies more often avoid the person use my own death stare turn ice cold and or sarcastic or use some other indirect method in essence normally google searches go by themes normally spend days to weeks researching mostly on specific topic then move to something else cinema all genres except horror reading everything except hardly ever get bored if am on my own and free to chose what to do but detest being in boring situations be it studying something boring essentially anything which involves no real same with me the main problem have had to face was when at work due to uncontrollable external factors was forced to perform below my own break even point note my own my output m not male but if may totally agree with what grey said used to be so serious and mature when was child and fairly serious teenager too when my favourite activity was to do too when was child used to play with the light filtering through the blinds and try and create as many patterns as possible it took me years to find out that other people didn do

personality tastes or something as deep as life changing decision besides management and recruitment on which won comment am of the view that mbti could be useful in improving team work and reducing conflicts in the workplace since it alerts to different thank you all for the warm welcome happy and azrael it italian m no exception wear black or dark clothes most of the the time as practical and comfortable as possible want shoes can walk confortably in and clothes which can forget about when m guess m ok as driver but don particularly enjoy it it boring having to concentrate on the traffic much prefer using public transport so that can think look around read or sleep no don believe that life has meaning in the big scheme of things our existence is an accident and will leave no trace but believe that we can chose to give meaning to our own life as agree entirely my fundamental values and beliefs haven changed much over time except that defined myself an atheist until the age of 16 then turned agnostic and have been ever since ',\n",

attracted to entjs lmnos pqrss or the danish nothing personal m attracted to non danish women you should do less reduction izing great observation definitely would sign up for linked in remember was considering to do it one week and heard news of massive security breach otherwise it would seem like preference the fact that everyone who replied to this question just gave away their vulnerabilities never mind all responses are duly noted ya know just in case of course now get back to work have those months but snap the heck out of it washed my mouth out with soap for months after leaving my ship if can use heck you can get your things done here the not so sketchy well let make this clear and take out people types altogether and this is purely subjective but m sure most in this section will see my viewpoint if you need assistance to accomplish my friend swore was an entj liked the description for intj more the test here says m an entp but also share some of the qualities of the stps or stjs depending on how much coffee had in sorry for the double post didn realize this happened technical difficulty please delete this redundant thread whats up there not much to say m about to embark on an incredible adventure so won be active for very long but ll probably be back eventually touched on this in high school the follwership part wearing off appropriately think it was more of an adaptation and m constantly adapting to new challenges its considerably more academic now have small amount of downtime but was wondering about this recently diffrent temperments really show up around here but wonder what my reflection looks like without the standard aila8 closure can be nice perhaps m turning into feeler anywho goodbye nonetheless feral sheep thank you who needs luck anyways thank my lucky stars that m not superstisious meh ve kinda dwelled here the most so ll post my goodbye message here ve been well informed about various personality types cognitive functions psychology in general and how different when move to new envornments have yet to keep in contact with anyone from the old it precisely because m so buisy and then eventually accidentally forget about them alltogether just out of curiosity are you actually going through this or was just very handsome posterboy for hypothetical situation crazy ooooooohhhh its on melodrama will fail you clear your mind and collect yourself write an mail to your superior job granter that you belived that this has happened make it perfectly there we go senerio one the job market sucks agree let try not to loose your job and consider options at this point there the classical tactiful approach where you can bring hahah love how people have actual issues and post in our section asking it in way that makes it sound like they re solely interested in our oppinions one more detail please who is this have transmorphed into an entj so can once again be an objective critic who judges your action as rational and pragmatic means to re rail the subject this is because had the strong desire to oh my his higher understanding of objective reality and its perpetually self constricting nature caused this topic to change derail and merge into that what annoys entjs topic shall take it that you didn see my comment as sarcastic crazy in other words thought it was strange imposition too haha he is of higher consiousness you would not understand hmm d say both it really depends on lot of things ll mark down intrapenuer because it definitely seems more fitting overall would think that we make decent intrapeneurs and are haha if happened to overhear you that would be an epic argument in regaurds to nuclear power posted this exact same subject while back estp or entj reading list carl jung i know what you mean d actually agree with that in many regaurds and woudln be suprised to see it verified think we re twins put down entj and call it day the first strife had with my emotions were their existance they were counterproductive miserable selfish and unnecessary in fact saw first of all food for thought nature is very important to me as well and tend to argue in very similar fashion you described m still an entj you might want to consider that option dont like pats on the back or small forms of touching dont mind punching or being punched after friendly insults however pushing can be obnoxious yet fun as well in non professional what about forest gump even though you were merely joking d actually agree with you all of the ___ ass phrases in there dosen really show healthy mindset if it requires thought and understanding yeah digest best with my mouth open crazy if it for fun the news or whatever nope haha fair enough meant no harm m grammar nazi not on fourms but if someone is typing an mail make sure it perfect even talk it out loud to see if it sounds right can help it for some reason oh and when the origional poster in regaurds to his question who are you talking to crazy be direct you don appreciate it but you want to be friends let him know also be willing to be open to diolouge and discuss subsequently if you re flustered or anxious for any reason tell ll be

not sure what my dad type is m guessing peace of mind waking up early to avoid seeing people in my dorm then just continuing throughout each day making the most of the little things guess would define peace of mind as happiness don drink or do drugs think it a bit out of fear of the consequences in my opinion there really no appeal either why would want to be intoxicated ap chemistry was my

either it m good leader and easily fall into that role if no one else steps up some of that skill is probably innate but also attended leadership camps during my high school years which reinforced good music funny webcomics and blue sky well that certainly darker turn than was expecting may be disillusioned with those in charge but it not something see as an unsolvable problem especially when m among others my age m with rosslyn for the most part don really see any need to change people beyond making them accepting and tolerant of each other after all each person plays unique and important role in d like to think that this sense of an obligation to humanity isn infj specific but do think we all have an obligation to humanity whether that be as scientist teacher or farmer m getting angry at people who cause harm to others is definitely an idealist thing in my opinion as you re standing up for the ideal of justice but that doesn mean it not related to upbringing as it depends how stressed am if it just mild stress ll either play video games or read basically lose myself in another world for awhile when get really stressed then tend to be more like blue grey it my favorite color and ve always seen it as mirroring my calm introspective nature tried it one summer couple years ago if it is possible lack the mental discipline for it even though didn succeed still won

bad side think m fairly good at lying although do run into problems if start smiling because that usually leads to uncontrollable laughter and things tend to go downhill from there m much better poof all the world problems are solved unfortunately everyone is now bored out of their skulls wish had tiny grain of sand poof you magically discover wish that is incorruptible however it takes all of your brainpower to hold onto the idea of such complex wish and you are forced into vegetative state in order to do change my mannerisms to match different groups of people but don see it as trying to

random letters into words when m writing by hand ll be writing sentence and the poof you now have job rolling stone up hill for all eternity and you re only paid cent year for it wish was

don really seem to matter much to me although think do lean slightly towards and all the girls ve fallen hard for so far my longterm memory is excellent short term not so much it either has to be numerical scheduled topographical or somehow striking for me to remember it the only things m really good at in the same vein ender shadow and ender in exile are both wonderful books with amazingly well developed characters as are most of card books for that matter be prepared for lot of screeching when you start it takes awhile to get used to using bow definitely switch to when m working or in class but that the only place ve really noticed it it comes quite naturally to me when it does happen though love certainty and life plan the trip to japan sounds nice too i definitely in the same boat when it comes to reading anything even remotely related to romantic relationships body language and verbal cues in that area always fly way over my head mythbusters best tv show ever it the only thing that makes me regret not having television in my opinion the bowed string instruments are among the most difficult to learn it a lot easier if you ve learned an instrument like piano before so you re familiar with reading playing and ve noticed myself doing similar things m always sitting at the back of the restaurant or cafeteria at an angle to watch the most people possible also tend to read people better when m not also have to agree with this will forgive just about anybody for just about anything m just not the kind of person who can bear grudge that being said if somebody does something to lose have multitude of reasons for being reserved one as you guessed is fear most specifically the fear of betrayal had close friend betray me and ve been much more wary since then in prefer 60 degrees fahrenheit with no wind as far as extremes go however much prefer cold can handle very cold temperatures as long as there no wind but heat just annoys me math was one of my favorite subjects in public school but get bored with it very quickly if m not learning something new haven continued with it in college precisely because of that d in my experience it very difficult for others to tell the difference between such things even with body language we re very good at hiding any of those things deep within ourselves and only open used to play the violin but haven had time to keep up with it since started college it pretty hard for me to get inspired most of the time but music definitely helps reading also helps there are some books that do really good job of motivating

thing that steers my away from isfj kylo and towards infp kylo is the degree of his playfulness kylo ren loves games kylo ren had thought if rey ends up being an infp instead of an isfp and kylo ren is an infp that would make an interesting dynamic infp vs infp and am all for that personally if am confessing it never like you or love you ll have thought about how want to express myself way before dare to express myself this is in part due to think it more obvious he an enfp he bleeds his ne all over the place constant improvising and possibility vision second to his ne is that fi and it due to the fi that finn cannot since added my thoughts about rey want to add my thoughts about ren support isfj kylo ren or looping infp kylo ren it really depends on the future installments as with rey this isn going to answer you directly but was going to post about rey typing and thought may as well do it in reply to you so here it is rey is fi dominant isfp fi se ni te not ha ha ve done this with female istps before annie leonhardt being an example because intp females lack screen time and so desperately want to see one on screen one that is well developed m too shy to say anything over mic m squeaky and would be like that fluffed up kitten spitting fury also m usually in party chat already it depends on the trolling if it my istp sister certainly doesn fit the mold she a very outgoing and social istp compartmentalizes everything just about can never have debates with her though because she says my ideas don know what been said not going through eleven pages right now so if m repeating what someone else has said forgive me isis needs to be destroyed they re messing everything up make math equation out of this general questions what type is easiest for you to type what type is hardest for you to type easiest for me is everything but istp and isfp hardest for me is istp and isfp talking about who on the receptive end rather than the enforcing end wouldn justice be empowering and vengeance be disempowering we re to assume if it another kid to save humanity and are you absolutely sure relate to this unless m gaming ex last night this guy ran past me killed the surrounding enemies then ran away to kill more enemies instead of reviving me well picked up my bunched did was going to go to the midnight release with an infj and others but ended up finishing couple of papers due the next day instead angry btw if anyone has ps4 and wants to be my interestingly enough eren initial motivation to slay titans is form of justice that twists into vengeance in the beginning eren wanted to free humans from the walls confines because ah yes villains that believe they are the heroes are the most believable villains maybe just maybe you ll finally meet person that really cares but they don it was just niceties also trust if you say trust you with this most secret information and learn have my fallout 4 pre order to be played once m 100 sync on syndicate unless decide otherwise are any of you of the vengeful sort very general question no specifics if there something anyone wants to specify for themselves feel free talking about vengeance in general is cool the impulses give into is going places such as the movie theater or the aquarium the fair or walking garden etc it doesn happen often but here how it is when it does happen one for me wouldn say listening to music is procrastinating it actually helps evoke emotion which helps me figure out what m feeling and then can pinpoint why feel the way do ve forgot about this post but all of the replies made me

hurt to make move on her try to get her into conversation and see how she acts sounds like she likes you this could be continuing of my previous thread but since know the infj is in theory the most compatible for me enfp not to mention that get strong energy and fulfillment from infjs thanks for the replies they are insighful any more opinions from an infj end are welcome wow havent been on here in while thank you for all who took the time to give advice and share their own personal experiences have found that most helpful appreciate your time and thanks everyone for the replies myjazz ouch not sure what you are getting at everyone else much appreciated thanks for replies sounds interesting still wondering from and infj point of view since if there is just lack of interest than not sure if want to pursue this thats why what you guys think just met my friends brother tonight for the first time who have heard some very good things about and was thinking about possible relationship it was in their house was sitting mostly know of an infj male who around most people appears to be very easygoing no temper very well behaved very sweet helpful accomodating affectionate and passionate about what he believes him thank you for the responses definitely gave me more clarity thanks for the replies can infjs come across as more logical especially to strong feeling types ie female infp and do they have wide variety of interests such as politics economics is an infj likely to get very into cause that he believes in and then debate it with someone who has an opposing view and get very emotionally caught up since he beleives in that so strongly how would an intj and infj differ in someone who is enneagram type 1 in terms of behavior thoughts etc which meyers briggs combinations are most likely those who go to law school or are interested in law and is it possible that there can be intuitive feelers nfs in law school since get the thank you all for the informative answers and perspectives have greater idea as to the answer was searching for you have been most helpful thank you all for taking the time to reply it is interesting hearing the different opinions from infjs in this regard so am still trying to get clarity although thus far do have more than hi there am an enfp and find myself most attracted to infj men the infj men know are all very nice people polite and softspoken my question is what would be the difference between an am dating this boy and am curious about his type he is definitely introverted values his time alone more than anything else though he is very congenial he also seems more laid back and hello must say am pretty confused on how to differentiate between an isfp and infp my friend can be both actually she is quite curious and intuitive yet isnt terribly introspective is thanks all for sharing from an infp point of view or esp an point of view am extrovert and at times an idiot dont think before speak that has cost me lot she has introverted hi infps have friend who believe is an infp great very sensitive girl but unfortunately due to childhood events not in the healthy level of personality she has very hard time with im curious which type is prone to be the most likely to do things that are typically out of the box the most likely to be told by others that they seem high or drunk at any given moment and do ive been reading about isfps and their being laid back and chilled out people can they especially if healthy be potentially hardworking whether in jobs or any aspect in life and even am curious about my sisters type have some ideas but am not really sure can tell you that she is 21 on the enneagram she is 4w3 f she is very emotional and its fairly am going to go with infp would think that more than any other type just started dating this guy have clue about his type but like outside opinions especially since the way he behaves is confusing to me we only went out twice and for some reason he is my bf is an istp pretty much fits the whole profile really cool guy self confident great troubleshooter doesnt take things personally and is respected ive been reading about istps in istps how do you feel about emotions positive or negative and showing them how do you express love im curious to see what am on the mbti still have to do some more research but curious what moe expert people have to say about me get recharged by being around people but usually actually im stuck betwen few types istj isfj estp and esfp possible can be others im gonna put up another picture tell me what guys think how are estpsin intimate relationships as lovers can you type this guy hes kinda interesting im pretty sure know the type wanna hear what you guys have to say happy understand that tinking types make decisions based on logic pros and cons and analysis and fellers make decisions based on other people and their feelings in the moment am wondering though can istjs with people they feel strongly about be eager to please and want do anything to help the other person can they be even romantic to point if thats what the partner wants usually in he likes to give actual examples to prove point as opposed to straight answers he likes to break rules when thinks its too confining though he is very into right and wrong with me he may let rouge thanks for the reply can see him as being people oriented and making sure people wont be hurt by his decisions but by default think he is more in his head even though around me he sparky thanks for the feedback think can possible rule out infj you did make me think when you suggested isfp and therefore am considering isfj and esfj as hispossible feeling types as hello am wondering if my husband can be an esfj or if it doesnt fit the esfj any feedback is welcomed he likes to give actual examples to prove point as opposed to straight answers hello am wondering if my husband can be an isfj see the helpfulness the gentleness at times the anger id one of his opinions are violated and the compassionate side he also can be good am wondering if anyone can give feedback or an idea on what my husband is am really curious as he is complex and actually fits some parts of various types such as entp enfj intp infj infp sparky wish it was that obvious that can tell what his letters are as easily as most people know the system fairly well and usually its more clear cut find him very complex and he sparky please dont get me wrong defintely appreciate all parts of person and happen to love the isfp type its one of my favorite mbti types actually and really would want him to be an someone tolld me my boyfriend may be an isfp see that as possiblity in that he is more reserved on things likes buying me presents likes pretty artwork and nature and doesnt like to express sparky to tell you the truth that was great call the only thing here is that since am feeler type the way look at people and describe them is in more of feeler tone and also im not interesting he has more developed feeling side fe yet he is defintely in his head and needs logic to understand some things on the emotional side and comes across as forceful in his thanks for the feedback thus far happy id have him take the test all the way but he refuses to since he is very against personality systems he thinks people are too complex for them he also thanks for the feedback thus far happy he is in getting the work done but he likes variety and assortment of different tasks hes an electricion and phone troubleshooter and likes doing ive been reading into the mbti and find it fascinating was wondering if my boyfriend can be possible infp infps on the board please feel free to give feedback and suggestions happy he intreresting he usually tells me to trust my gut but that can be an intuitive thing ive read about enfp and can defintely see him having lots of components but the difference here is is thanks for the replies they are very helpful entp thats interesting havent considered that was thinking partially since he has argumentative opinionated and judgemental side to him and ',\n",

opposite of post quick reply it worked for me even after went offline honored to be mentioned by m afraid know next to nothing about enneagrams mbti other than infp divorce law bi polar ptsd or add do still have an initial opinion but may ask few allskyblue let the posts stay don take it personally they re only talking about how life feels for themselves right now they didn criticize your life or anything you said if you re happy dream nearly every night they re like movies mostly dramas thrillers others would consider them nightmares should write them all down turn the best ones into stories but don fallingdown m sure you didn upset him really he answered all your questions without any hint of resentment hurt or frustration whatsoever and even when he wrote that last post there along the lines of what infalliple said when you don want love you re headed towards your own dream that projects confidence and certain type of beauty attractiveness especially in braveheart before read your post 17 sorry for any late reply it takes me awhile sometimes to think things through for complicated issues and simultaneously get sunk into other braveheart m busy writing my reply right now it might take few hours and it probably won include your recent post brief scan right now my reaction is holy crap well now that don worry you re doing good if girls want to spend time with you that a good sign you re basically doing nothing wrong as turtleducks said lots of long distance relationships don last past well at least you re being honest here about your lying that a great first start isn it if you feel sleeplessly bad about lying then maybe your heart body is telling you that lying isn i don get it 2 dates in 6 years seems impossible maybe you ve met quite few men but not been attracted to them for reasons so you never went out with them don think ve ever not smart move ll reply to this later mimi 2 original reply to lol okay ll try thanks can really answer your question since m relatively new here plus don go out of my way to meet people either here or in could you please be more respectful m asking politely don mistake that for vulnerability however can be an incredibly merciless asshole you can fault icarus for not giving you can add anything to the other good posts about your ex anyway d be more concerned with reducing the possibility of cheating in future relationships do believe we have some control over think it hard to really know what you ll like or be good at until you actually try it so going to school for something you haven yet tried seems very risky gamble personally used the oh see what you re saying don know about other infps but shutting down was normal for me because personally need more space time when m making huge life decisions take my life your mom sounds toxic she the main source of your stress avoid toxic substances unless they re willing to metamorphosize into non toxic which in this case would be miracle very few people don think you should consider transferring before you ve even started m from ca but went to small liberal arts college called haverford in pa with about 1 200 students so it for many women at least after high school looks aren always the main priority it something else or multiple other things about you that not attracting them qualities such as confidence don read poetry or books but when first read this poem long time ago it was like seeing my soul reflected encapsulated by few words particularly the italicized lines emily ve seen some of the other recent threads you posted ve wanted to reply to few but tend not to post unless can contribute be thorough or feel compelled to it the latter right now adamant wasn following your exchange with eos too busy engaged missj so can make judgment about who being more logical find those classical logic laws bit debatable but meltedsorbet astrology dolts isn logical it implies that astrology has no use value what if young person knew nothing about personality and then started to read astrology adamant sorry but if you know about triple point then there no point in asking missjordan et al 1 point taken feelings intuition are valid but they aren always right adamant water can exist in all 3 states at the same time it called the triple point look it up missjordan oh see you believe the ultimate purpose of logic the reason it was invented is to make sense not to find out the truth no wonder conventional philosophy has the missjordan if your purpose is winning losing arguments then statements not backed by reasoning will lose this doesn take away from their truth value which is valuable in and of itself missjordan human beings have imperfect knowledge our science to date based on rationality logic can only have limited understanding which is why feelings or intuition have their place you re welcome apologies for the directness try to stay thinking based but still get impassioned in this case when think see

are chose yes would become vigilante vampire targeting rapists human traffickers genocidal warlords officers oppressive dictators etc may also consider extreme white collar criminals you should still try to identify what is causing triggering your stress otherwise you re just dealing with the symptoms and not the source you ll just be on an endless cycle of stress listen to adverse also 1 that freaked me out because didn know him that well follow your instincts in the future nip it in the bud before you get snowball effect like this you may get more responses if you include personal side to your question most infps seem to respond better to the personal emotional rather than the theoretical abstract if you talked about know very little about type so can address those questions there is usually logic to emotions but they probably can be understood by conventional methods of reasoning for wish knew the guy he the one that should be asking for perspective d at least tell him you

              " ' picture of me now 74944 thanks also am an infp and am interested in an entj that just recently met online on dating site there seems to be something about him that really like in the little bit of email correspondence can totally relate to this post what you said describes perfectly what it means to be an infp at least the kind of infp am you worded it perfectly it sounds like you are totally supportive of her that is great am sure the relationship will work out because you really are very concerned and caring about her am thinking one reason she personally don think it is big no no but it has been my experience in the past that whenever have tried to hash out my feelings with boyfriend that they get sick of listening to me agree with the others who said just be yourself but as an infp guess the best advice could give you is when she wants to talk about what is bothering her when it comes to other people who are when you have to get up at 5 in the morning but find yourself posting online to personality forum at 12 52 m when you avoid like the plague any kind of confrontation when people are disrespecting you but you are the first one to defend the underdog or vulnerable you wonder if certain foods can be evil such as refined white sugar you feel lonely but the idea of actually calling someone on the phone horrifies you so you watch few youtube videos of thanks am an infp come from background where my parents and siblings are not religious at all father is an atheist mother agnostic and sisters either agnostic or atheist but none of them like the you ve just happily exposed your innermost thoughts on personalitycafe and then flipped flopped your view on all of this by wondering if you now look insane for all your personal postings and are it seems like am the only person know of practically who can stand pt cruisers there is just something about them that seem so much like an eyesore which is weird because could care think intj infp is good match forgot to mention in my post that looks don matter to me hardly at all it makes no difference whether man is tall short skinny or 300 pounds bald or tons of hair what matters to me is you know your an infp when you have just completed your 38th upload to youtube all on the subject of why paul is false apostle and even though you realize no one actually cares or is watching your prefer being around nf and nt in general the doorbell the phone ring your too sensitive do you mind if don get offended but am half convinced my ideal man would be another infp but the only problem is once dated one and he ended up hating me or at least it felt that way and it felt like we both were too sensitive actually googled misanthrope about year ago because wondered if was one and once googled it was half convinced was one yup ve got anxiety bigtime ocd social phobia generalized anxiety hypochondria phobias reading trying to learn hebrew interacting with my son studying the bible totally feel like am an empath so much so that have lately for the past few years hid from most of mankind just because it is so overwhelming to be in the same room as most people and being rude to waitress or other person waiting on you complaining about having to wait in line talking about how your last girlfriend was dramaqueen or something equally negative making chivalry leadership kindness great with children patience humility humor love for god love for animals totally gentle with females and protective of females good with money and it is hard to find someone who would understand me and who would be trustworthy plus am not even sure if am supposed to be with anyone tell me what on your mind how was your day yes am 40 and often have 20 year old calling me hon totally attract the wrong kind of people it makes person become really reclusive after while people who are into status or domination also insensitive people who blurt out ignorant things also people who can think outside the box people who are cold to children or animals now live near fort worth texas but am originally from connecticut and have lived in rhode island really love texas just moved here this summer and it is so nice and the people are omg that totally describes me perfectly love these especially the recess one the math one and the jaws one so true that is so true you know your an infp when youtube becomes your best and only friend and you find that you have created not just one but three channels and you find yourself obsessively searching for infp videos totally identify with what you are saying hate it when people judge people yet am the worst at internally judging others so true find tv very depressing too for some reason tend to get really really depressed when sitcoms are on and people in the room with me are laughing hysterically but for some reason it makes me in fact am such guilt person that at one point when was going to psychologist for counseling because of my severe anxiety he would keep falling asleep on me during the sessions for few omg you are so right what you said about them buying into gender roles too much think you are on to something there because all three enfj i have known in my life 2 males and 1 female all agree with your assessment of them remember when dated one for year internet long distance relationship remember being so jealous of him all the time because he had cult like you still sleep with stuffed animal at the age of 40 you still live with your parents at the age of 40 you feel like child yet you feel like you have lived for thousand years wow that is so awesome that describes perfectly what it feels like to be an infp am constantly cringing over how many s or me or my i have in my emails and if notice it it can trigger think another reason infp can worry they are borderline is because borderlines see everything as black or white no grey and infp can do that too for example things are evil or pure versus totally can relate to this thread feel extremely self conscious in my body and am always aware of it like feel like my muscles are constantly tense am surprised haven had heart don think so at all at least for me as an infp do not feel as if have persuaded one human being ever to do anything in fact that is one area that feel totally hopeless in think know that lot of infp myself included have severe social anxiety and feel extremely socially awkward so it may be that the infp that takes lot of time doing stuff around the house is am super self absorbed but feel super guilty about being super self absorbed ',\n",

              " ' tend to have always done stuff like that especially with batman 1989 being in my room watching some of my favorite anime or beating the crap out of stuff on smash bros tend to retreat to the most comfortable place can go and just wait it out or try to solve it one school year it was my desk space under my bed that set up to look like nerd cave yeah have moments where m like oh wow look at her and gosh wonder what kind of personality she has is she nerd what is she like definitely not love though just someone that catches my for me id say its factor along with personality and other things interests dislikes activities and etc of course have my personal traits that m more drawn towards like riy pointed d agree m very much so an artist been drawing for years even made it my major in collage about to get my ba in graphic design just love it very much so night person when m on breaks from school go nocturnal wake up around 3 4pm and sleep around 7 8am m not as bad as used to be but do have my moments still its mostly art related stuff that start but never see though to the end granted some of those instances have different actually have professors underestimate me which is surprising disappointing out of all of the professors ve had only like 1 seems to really know what m capable of doing and doens set the really dislike arguing especially hate arguing when know that m 100 correct if its matter of facts or someone just wanting to pick everything say apart for me when had sig other it was always the little things that she noticed remembered from the time we spent together its amazing how small things make all the difference remember one day yeah the rejection part is hard for me cause one of the last crushes had was friend so had already let my guard down and open up little to them and then its like bam why did reveal so tend to just drink until get to that point where feel just right then sit and chill don enjoy getting drunk did it on my 21st and one other time but beyond that probably never despite how much tend to punish myself when it comes to some things d say more of sadist cause like gilded said if someone gets on my bad side which takes some effort m more woudln know but love cats for me find that some are just able to understand their favorite person without too too much trouble mine for example can tell my mood and does what she can to ve been wondering this for years cause back middle through even college get sick of seeing guys like me nice gentle loose out to the bad boys when it comes to girls its beyond to be honest ve gotten to be less inclined to confess the past few years last time even considered it the girl started backing away and seeming to half avoid me d be happy if had the for me feel like m always just punishing myself after certain point when find new crush have been single for near 4 years and every crush ve had hasn panned out at all they just m understanding loyal and caring very it has gotten little better but yeah still rather on the shy side family pets wise we have boxer and jack russel my pet is the cat tested 9 but need to be more informed feel lonely and unloved all the time even though know friends and family love me have to remind myself of this most of the time feel the need to be constantly reminded this one symphonic rock heavy metal rock and etc if were to have woman try to court me d say method just because d rather spend the tennis match getting to know them slowly so that d have better idea of what think of them find it hard to talk about sensitive topics with most people that why have my select friends that confide in and even then only allow each one to know but so much for me the fastest way to personally didn consider myself weird for years until got to middle and high school and people started labeling me people made me feel weird because of my interests tastes music tv etc my mom says that was rather quiet child mean misbehaved quite bit but that only lasted for those toddler years overall was rather quiet child despite my surroundings granted some can be rather awkward depending on the situation and person d say normally m just like 5 lol but it does get really bad especially when m around girl really like have crush on then do feel that there are lot of people that underestimate us even have friend or two that underestimate me and they know me fairly well it quite frustrating but at the same time it makes me what do you think of the above accurate wrong d say they re pretty accurate as far as m concerned the only thing question is the naughty eyes thing lol ve only had one person really just overall avoid lot of stuff like that d rather be alone in my room than deal with lot of that mess plus ear buds and loud music helps when can escape the area agreed would definitely say m artistic creative m and artist graphic design major considering my major graphic design do feel out of place in some classes because m not as vocally expressive as some of the other people around me m usually really quiet and work on my really enjoy symphonic rock like within temptation and etc stuff that just touches me on an emotional level for me can give good explanation to what consider love my definition of it keeps changing as the years go by and as my failed attempts at relationship pop up do also consider the past yeah tend to only really open up to small number of people and even then have yet to be 100 with someone mainly because usually when do some people tend to betray my trust and half turn my way of flirting usually ends up being me voicing things that ve already thought about that particular girl like you always look great when someone says something about their outfit that day m rather lazy during the day but m more active at night when the rest of the house is asleep best time for me to draw too m pretty big on felines especially tigers currently m senior in college so that a job in itself would like to do web design stuff as of now could change suikoden final fantasy vii chrono trigger legend of zelda etc m definitely very soft spoken have tried off and on over the years after middle school just gave up on the idea plus realized that there are just some thoughts that don want anyone to know about normally go in my room and lock my door enjoy my privacy and the quiet live on campus during the semester so when m home want to enjoy the personal space 1 did you always see yourself as somewhat of an artist knew you had artistic inclination looking back guess knew but didn really think about it lot until got to the 5th and 6th would you make up your mind if you re interested in me or not would have to say that is the case with me prefer to get to know someone well before even pursue relationship and if even like them that much have to like them lot and want something tend to do small things for the person that really care about that may not seem as much at first but eventually add up used to do portraits of the women that had crush feelings for but heck the past few years that ve been single have given me time to sit down and figure out how the heck managed to even have my first relationship

              " ' m feeling really low this evening have recurring pain problem in my right foot the sudden drop in temperature outside is making it twinge something dreadful ve been taking really good rrrrghhh feel so angry trying to keep it in check since ve been lashing out at my girlfriend quite bit lately and know she had long hard day poor thing she already fell asleep ve always struggled with anxiety it was especially bad when was small child it was always there gnawing at my gut but didn have word for the feeling by the time got to college i am so bone tired too many people and feel burnt out things feel kind of awkward and stilted with my girlfriend of 3 1 2 years because we re both really busy and stressed out to stressed out well have professional diagnoses of social anxiety post traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder having no access to private space makes me acutely uncomfortable basically hi there so work in pretty typical corporate office in cubicle actually quite enjoy my job however today it was announced that the higher ups are 99 sure we re going to switch from you re such strong person you re kind of an inspiration really you re so cute you have such calming influence you really have it all together ha ha ha not true but what terrible day couldn even contain my tears till got home so put my hand over my nose and mouth and squeezed my eyes shut in an effort to keep from sobbing my foot still hasn healed hardly ever feel lonely and am actually quite pleased with how many friends acquaintances ve cobbled together in recent years because used to be super solitary don have lot of social was super touchy very fussy very easily made upset screamed whenever we went anywhere new restaurants for example so my parents just stopped taking me places not saying that necessarily ugh really really really hate scholarship applications today realized feel more love affection for music beauty art the universe etc than for other people in fact when felt tender vulnerable toward another person recently it kind of blew think there are two pieces really feel like it important to always be trying to improve yourself because if not you re living in stasis so why are you even living that how see it people call me smarter than call myself grew up hearing was smart was in advanced classes got good grades without really trying etc but often wonder about what intelligence really ve always been very fond of my face haven really ever done that thing where stare in the mirror and analyze my nose or whatever not even when was in high school very much like my used to be sick with cold symptoms for about week out of every month that was when was really stressed in college high school super busy had bad home life etc my physical health is it been 4 years or so since last wrote seriously think ve lost my writer voice and have no idea how to get it back again really feel like used to have potential everyone told overeating alcohol chocolate coffee videogames m dancing alone to club music at bar close alone in my apartment m so lonely can hardly stand it but ll keep drinking apple pie schnapps until forget that bit of it and just lose myself people who blare music through their headphones in public places it drives me insane cannot for the life of me understand why there is no socially acceptable way to tell people they are being am gonna just echo what my therapist tells me all the time you don have to do anything to be good enough you have always been good enough and you are good enough and you always will be thank you for this have been thinking lately about how often am moved to tears by music being out in nature etc and how grateful am for that suppose m much more vulnerable to emotions just so tired and agitated all at once so much internal stress and not sure how to diffuse it maybe this is what my therapist means when she says need to learn the practical skill of how to take ve always tested as infj but lately ve been testing as intj can feel the slow shift over from feeling into thinking too it feels strange and rigid and tiring so maybe it not real m on the outside m really proud to be an infj on the inside m still working on chipping away at all the years of feeling like was inferior or crazy or strange it a slow process but think ugh it is cold and gray and bleak and has been for days it almost june so the heat is off in our apartment so here sit freezing to death and feeling glum as hell as if don already for at definitely true broke the same bone in my foot twice in one year because went too hard good to remember especially since the moderation point probably extends beyond physical things as well this friend had threatened me with physical harm when refused to date him so went to the police and never saw or talked to him again completely scary and unacceptable will not oh my gosh all the time in fact it a topic that comes up lot with my therapist she expresses concern that overextend myself on regular basis trying to do all the things but tell her m only 25 but have no urge to settle down m really committed person but just don see the point in rushing into marriage honestly don care that much about ever being married to be sometimes the break in your heart is like the hole in the flute sometimes it the place where the music comes through andrea gibson gospel salt hmm don know if it exactly the same thing but get something similar anything really beautiful like painting symphony etc makes me feel really withdrawn and sad like enjoy it _ pretty much it not really intentional just kinda happens thankfully my closest friends understand though most people don are offended yeah this happens lot try as might always kind of drift off and come back if focus really hard can be more present for the conversation but it quite tiring think it gotten nope nothing good anyway don do lot of rap or anything but with any kind of poetry always need like three drafts before it palatable hmm don know what anyone else does but look everywhere except in people eyes always want to but find meeting other people eyes so intense intimate that can prolong it and self respect and self confidence do try to eat healthily and really like fruits veggies whole grains but when m stressed anything that is instantly edible is what eat crackers and cereal out of the box cold leftovers hate hate hate hate hate interviews have three interviews between now and tuesday and feel about ready to explode m quite socially anxious so interviews are one of my biggest fears aqualung and daydr3am thanks for the suggestions my thyroid and my blood have both been checked and it all came out ok one of the doctors said that did have somewhat low red blood cell thanks everyone for the input it might very well be an emotional thing hadn really thought of that it is encouraging to hear that maybe all infjs aren tired all the time makes me hopeful hey all do you consider yourself to be low energy person what do you do about it my experience regulate my energy the best can but feel continually frustrated by how taxing it is zech still don really think being an infj comes from traumatic childhood exactly but what you said about the link between insecure attachment depression anxiety makes sense maybe the real sorry op can contribute much except to say that have trouble with this too can usually tell fair amount about people but have total blind spot when it comes to whether people want oh no m lesbian and can imagine being stuck in small town hope you can move to bigger city once you graduate things became lot better for me sexually and socially once went to fehhhh didn care about it much in the traditional sense by which mean never saw virginity as stamp of shame or virtue or whatever mostly wanted to get the damn thing over with because had somewhat traumatic childhood absent neglectful and or unsupportive parents but don think it made me an infj per se during the worst years withdrew more into myself and tested appear laid back but m secretly pretty reactive that is under times of stress people always comment on how seem calm to have it together etc but my body is very tense feel anxious my wow so many responses it feels like too much to respond to everyone individually but thanks to everyone for the input proud m glad m not alone can ask how old you are know everybody develops at different times etc but m curious like to think ll get more comfortable with my shell with age thanks moltenhorse

want to break us out of our shells but they really don offer much went back and re read the title and the first post few times think get it now why very valid point hope to get large enough sample and then compare that to the standard frequency of hair colors and then we could bust out the statistics and figure out the degree of see where you re coming from d like to note that the ennegram forum came to the conclusion that m actually 3w4 and don have the competitve drive m not saying you re wrong m an intp my best friend is an istj seems like m destined to help with this thread the istj is definitely lot more agressive than me he takes competition incredibly seriously loss rise and shine mr freeman rise and shine not that wish to imply you have been sleeping on the job no one is more deserving of rest and all the effort in the world would have gone to this was an amazing post seriously can see you put lot of time and heart into it ve thought about it good deal and you re certainly right ve relied on my ti my whole life it sure understand what you re saying just wanted to know at this current moment in time if we were to observe all of the intp in the universe would there be trend what hair looked like as opposed to single choice with radio button m definitely an intp and to be completely honest this doesn really apply to me always like to go into situations blind and use my ti and ne to figure out what to do agree that you was hoping grey would cover it but suppose should have elaborated you could always choose other observation your profile picture is missingno but before dismiss this thread what did you honestly hope this thread would accomplish not asking sarcastically but genuinely tend to assume lot of things about other people based on their hair color it probably wrong but before dismiss it do intp tend to have certain hair color it always nice to have new recruit in the intp army together we shall conquer the other types certainly ve dated many women in high school college but ve realized every single one of them was feeler which for me anyways is recipe for disaster entp intrigue me because they so it is didn even notice gentlemen we have three months to prepare 2013 is our year to conquer the dating scene have the same thoughts toward dubstep that do towards anime most of them especially the popular ones are absolutely awful but if you look through all the trash you can find few to be during my lunch break tend to throw on some headphones and walk aimlessly around the city used to keep the headphones off in case met somebody interesting but it never happened really good suggestion wonder how recent college graduate could do anything there though suppose m still young enough that could pretend m student conclusion am the only intp in the city of pittsburgh yes suppose am having someone else who understands my ti and develops my ne sounds exciting not to mention ve dated way too many extraverted feelers what you say all your it nice to have another intp throw in his opinion m very much in agreement with you jeffbobs entp seem to be drawn to drastic physical displays of nonconformity in the real world they from my brief observations of this forum ve learned that when it comes to relationships you don find entps they find you so my question is what do you look for when you decide whether perhaps this could be my next thread lemme see what can dig up here aha although intp have more simple needs from interpersonal relationships than most other types have it very important that they keep up their generally like to spend time solo people tend to frustrate me but every now and then get fired up and want to go out and do something where do intps typically hang out in pittsburgh we have pretty similar tastes from the sound of it recently got into l4d2 and really enjoy it ll keep an eye out for the other games you recommended have an istj friend that plays that game religiously the learning curve way way too high for me personally not to mention the gameplay fell bit on the repetitive side hey navi could you offer some tips for fellow intp my fe frankly scares the heck out of me it constantly looks to other people to try to feel validated m never good enough and in the friend of mine gave me advice you might want to consider whenever you feel tense or nervous figure out the opposite of that feeling in this case relaxed and confident focus on making your ve actually read good deal on intp becoming teachers the common consensus is that it can work but only under two conditions 1 intp function better in higher levels of academia there think lot of us do that it what puts the into intp no just because society encourages you to have the most friends doesn mean you need to play along we just prefer quality over the level of wit in this thread is fantastic well done my fellow intps wow that seriously me in nutshell the good and the bad think need to print this out and hand it out to potential girlfriends hello this is what you re getting into ve heard lot of good things about guild wars 2 ve always been super reluctant to actually pay money for an mmo but maybe ll give this one try dude we ve had like the same game career m really into tf2 and pretty much exclusively play medic spy and engi are fun too and also played wow on an accelerated private server shot maybe that why can get into them agreed m an intp my istj friend really loves the show as well also it been said before but why isn this poll ve tried world of warcraft as well as several other mmo they all struck me as way too rigid and repetitive played mabinogi for long time but other than that haven found one hello m wandering intp ve never met an entj before theoretically we are supposed to really get along my ti is the compliment to your te but would think that the higher standards oh man this is dead on ve dated many enfp we re always naturally attracted to each other at first always act as her escape from reality and she becomes my escape from my mind the logic it so beautiful give me moment to take this in sorry m used to people getting really emotional about photos you definitely strike me as thinker perhaps ti xxtx exactly you re like an endangered species hence the topic never thought of it that way interesting so perhaps should ask where to find intj then can use them as bait i just got out of college this june my job has been mostly grunt work and training so far ll defer my answer until some more substantial projects come up that said esxx are generally know this question wasn necessarily aimed at me but figured d share work in call center typically am left alone but some certain esxx can seem to get the hint find that was really solid post zeep thank you ll try to shift my focus away from flagging down an entp more towards bettering myself _ it intrigues me that you couldn mention hello m wandering intp on our forum we have topic that discusses where to meet intp women which is rather interesting so if you don mind my asking where would likely meet slowly backs away ',\n",

reason have an odd paranoia like people might stalk me that and also feel self conscious have this same feeling of self conscious ness that has sort of prevented me sometimes when m waking up have

find very awesome and she was an enfp xd really love enfps now wonder whether my bestie is one because while ve lost some is amused lol waves hello welcome 3 tries to think of something to entertain

letter for less than millisecond and then m like are you like living in parallel dimension as me xd lol would pity but was in my own sort of down in the cave of woe today so have none to give at the moment realize find much comfort was reading chapter books while my older cousin was still with 5 sentence books and had chance to go up grade twice actually when was little didn take it because didnt want to was up until recently now im always tired so tired that if given the freedom to would sleep 24hours straight but that might be health related used to always be up at night reading watching live with my introverted parents and well imagine it would be nicer if it was just my intj father and my isfj mother comes around sometimes to mother over then only baby chick she has left long ago was told that once im eighteen can do what want but until then obviously the opposite so tried to identify what caused me to rebel in any form to my parents that was my emotions im probably not really the best person to answer because well dont have any such experience and im really young but here goes my two cents decisions that drive me up wall asking questions and really the only place feel comfortable at times is with my family in otherwords the ones grew up with hence they know im wierdo and know lot of their nuances that make them odd along personally don know what to say about global warming don worry about it but that doesnt mean dump oil in to the water supplies and hope polar bears will die think being green is good im lazy if can think of anything for status don write anything anyhoo dont like to have many ppl fussing around my page tongue m really slow eater as little kid was always the last to leave the table depending on the day about 75 of the time that me kind of have

add dont like my own company want to see what others navy blue when was kid liked yellow my saving grace for school is that can remember my day in class like in history my teacher does the lecture style with powerpoint retain most of that info that she said and in gets packed in math and history are my better subjects ve always been good with science too cant seem to write well for english though infps are suppossed to be good at that arent they school over all amanda think you just made my day personally seem to have issues with isfjs for some reason im not structured or traditional enough for them personally could be considered way to laid back hahaha well that fine welcome to pc happy not that would count because im little paranoid at times my cousins say they ve seen things in their house before like hands and shadows of people passing the windows they make good stories sad worry for him bit he does though seem to have like transformed into something cruel but he really cool person to be around my brother has also told me some sort of swindling plan to suck out money of ex parent mellow more or less dealing with how he wasnt there for my childhood and how he didnt pay child support ummm for the last couple days ve been thinking about things my brother has told me and no matter how hard ve looked at them it just seems real unusual for me emotional people should cant ever seem to keep friendships moved to suburban place where you technically can be put at disadvantage if you werent born there tend to like to make friends with people who welcome wink people on pc are really great well at least think that im an infp as well im an student have b in english though now english has never been my fav class dry having no social life has apparently left me with loads of time to waste on schoolwork im taking high end crazy it really late where am im getting worried about my personality type too because feel im morphing in to something else currently have the over analyzing disease but more or less live in my pajamas at home at school t shirt hoody or sweater rarely and jeans on the days feel randomly happy though ve been known to apparently show some style shocked today was one my cousin enfp is absolutely wonderful but dont think she cares for art nearly as much as she cares for people my other cousin esfp her sis and used to laugh at her in teasing way of used to draw cant seem to color so the word maybe then should be sketched failed my first art class in 8th grade crazy seemed to have really started once had friend that really seemed questioning bored thoughts mellow dreaming proud vague cool overeactant frustrating ll be back later to see if anyone knows what this is or if like always wasnt paying attention dont think learned about it in school sorry bout the double post frustrating crying for some reason feel bit scared right now im currently in health and the last thing we are learning is about death and dying that

foreign languages proud if had more time might go back to continue learning japanese and italian im taking spanish for school and school just takes the fun waking up and finding myself as me in

especially if they have special powers xd vegeta from dragon ball is another example used to type him as xntj but he is definitely strong si user m pretty sure misinterpreted his si for ni for whatever reason estj works but elsa from frozen gets typed infj all the time where is her ni don see it at all she is isxj her si is very obvious to me m unsure about fe or te as can see both m leaning m going to make second guess about the guardians have hunch that the main cast aside from possibly rocket and yondu are feelers peter exfp gamora isfp for sure her fi se is personally have hard time seeing her as si dom yes she most certainly has si and ne how people see her as entj will never know but can see her as sensor when think of very just got into this show and absolutely love it m still unsure about the townsfolk but think have the main characters down for the most part here we go steven enfp his fi ne is ve never seen the show but just found the movie on netflix liked it lot better than thought would and actually recommend it it silly but it has really fun characters ll give what about yami yugi atem pharaoh from yu gi oh ve seen people type him as infj makes sense to me especially in season 0 pretty much agree with the above joel isfp mike isxp crow enfp servo estp gypsy esfj dr forrester entp tvs frank enfp pearl entj now that ve watched more episodes m fairly certain patrick original personality is isfp new episodes he hardly has personality maybe really stupid estp that a big maybe but don goku from dbz aladdin stan from south park big bird pumbaa mary margarete from once upon time bambi can also see gamora from guardians of the galaxy as isfp the movie version of her where are people getting si for squidward aside from constantly getting annoyed by his neighbors don see it also lot of people seem to be typing spongebob as enfj yes he fe to the see vader as istj maybe prequel anikan was enfp though imo he has se rather than ne but certainly not the original trilogy find it interesting that people type davy jones as infp villains am sure about loki infj no doubt in my mind hans definitely can see as enfj prince john from the animated robin hood an incredibly whiny infp xd regina from once upon accidental double post really really appreciate your help thank you for helping me clarify that m very much okay with being infp they are very creative and make for really fun characters in movies tv the only oh that an interesting way to put it hmm well all my life ve always struggled with being shy and socially awkward it does not help that have cognitive learning disorder which thank you so much for responding to me usernames are not fun honestly haven considered istj just may have to do some more research on that at this point can rule it out since m for the longest time thought was ixfp in fact was positive was however ve been having second thoughts know for sure m an ixfx but ve been noticing lot of si or what am was thinking the same thing actually almost everyone know who takes the test online test as simply because of how some of the questions are worded then they feel all proud of themselves yes you explained that wonderfully there just no way goku enfp se fi to the absolute core with next to zero ne still don understand where people are getting ne from him because he m guessing piccolo more intj honestly see more si in vegeta than do piccolo quote atarulum 22451882 goku could be estp quote no doubt he has se ni can say see any fe in him though out of curiosity where are you getting that he a thinker guess m not understanding where you re getting ne si fi te 100 agree with but the only thing can possibly think of that would make him ne would be his idealistic morals of allowing also dude where can take that test that looks awesome yeah don see lot of ni in your answers definitely si for sure which establishes your ne think it now matter of are you fe or fi if that were the case wouldn that make you isfj so you only watched through season 7 why that out of curiosity hehe thank you laughing believe it or not just started watching spongebob granted it was really popular when was in high school but never paid much attention to it but thanks to be proud especially since pretty much agreed with everything you listed here xd sorry googled spongebob myers briggs and it brought me here so m sorry for replying late to this goku isfp his fi se is all over the place gohan infp the best got for him so far chi chi esfj fe ftw goten isfp can think of any other type for him krillin isfj vegeta how is spongebob entp there no doubt in my mind that he has ne but really can see that as his dom curious about your thoughts my fellow americans sponge bob esfj strong fe for sure but where are people getting ni from if anything he has weak ne patrick ixfp that has potential but is way too lazy to do anything about it perhaps you relate to her ne wow it been so long since ve seen this scene vegeta a fascinating character isn he can see what you mean about his si and how could have been mistaking it with ni for the ooo nice thank you chuncky anything better than gt ll even take the end of dbz over that vegeta mustache is just all kinds of wrong speaking of vegeta m sort of having yeah there no way he a or an he definitely some kind of enxj yeah true ugh really hate that ending love goku he one of my favorite characters but still mon man hope this new dbz series dragon ball super will write that off as goku isfp so much fi se vegeta want to say entj but m having doubts about how much te he has future trunks infp gohan infj chi chi esfj bulma enfj she definitely has fe at first thought he was esfp but the more thought about it the more certain am that he fi dom he warm hearted but kind of on his own terms he loves his friends and wants to protect them out of curiosity why would you want to be an a lot of the time find myself wishing had more especially se since they are so eager to see explore their surroundings and take action my don see how mary ann is infp yes she sensitive yes she shy kind and what not but swear she has more fe than fi recently found some of the books and was reading through them and i re watched the first madagascar movie the next two are on my to do list here what gathered from the first movie alone alex esfp marty enfp glory esfj melman isfj stan estj though can see estp in certain episodes francine esfj with suppressed wild side hayley isfp steve estp maybe entp roger entp all the way so much ne klaus istj m sorry can see it also don see how he wants to make the world better place at all he even said so himself do really look like guy with plan you know what am m dog what about the penguins just saw the new penguins of madagascar movie and ve been trying to type them never watched the show and it been forever since ve seen the madagascar movies so why did you type stan as an infp out of curiosity butters seems more infp than he is don see kyle as intp whatsoever but m curious as to what your reasons are for typing him m not okay here we go right now m shooting for isfp fi se or istj si te for stan leaning more

              " ' that probably because it hard to get consistent view on types using mbti you are probably lii intj and your friend sei isfp or you are ili intp and your friend esi isfj haha well if that really was true don you think that a pretty bad definition of being human considering 70 don fit it so you don think thinkers can have hurt feelings or well you don it not good idea to try to improve an inferior function but there are some things you can do be prepared it puts less pressure on te if you have had time to take care of why do you care your type is not gonna change to something else just because others view isfps in certain way if that is even true don know if you are good in academics that means things entp likes in partner 1 friendly warm easy going 2 helps you relax 3 shows emotions naturally 4 doesn argue about relationships 5 helps you focus on worldly matters when needed learn socionics yeah it takes while but it not impossible try to hang out make friends with the same quadra it doesn mean that you will connect with all of them far from it but the enfj _________ wrote the post you quoted long time ago anyway you cannot just swap p for introverts to get the socionics type there is no automatic way of converting the types but often types are the basically the strength of the esfp is great flexibility in personal relationships and understanding of power of course don know if you really are esfp see but here are some descriptions yes many esfp are good natural leaders it the same type as the see politician in socionics the esfp is one of the types that is most centered on personal power and ve noticed that many your re right about that esfp is very common among politicians reinin dichotomies requires knowledge of socionics not only to read the article about them but to observe these things in real life for long time and categorizing people through the socionics am glad it was even though didn use my translate to intuitive language software when writing it they do not exactly in the same way because all dual pair have different interests am standing at the end of the world with no fear no fear shocked actually it is 100 right but it takes many years of observations and life experience to realize this people in these it interesting in mbti there is the n opposition that people want to emphasize because the model keeps them separate so some people assume that sensors and intuitors cannot communicate very type god istj as he appears in the old testament yes he is definitely enfj don understand why some people want to type him as an introvert or thinker his speeches are extremely outgoing dramatical emotional manipulating and affecting the enfj entp isfp is duality natural match so just go for it and follow your instincts try to do things where you both can be yourselves away from demands of the environment work school give each of course you have chemistry with an istp you and him are duals iee sli that the best type match trust your instincts but don trust everything you read on the internet it actually better to think of same type code as being corresponding types so isfj isfj esi and isfp isfp sei etc so then the functional order is different but the functional socionics is very accurate but it a whole theory of compatibility it not enough to read through some website and then think you know it the socionics relationships can seem suspiciously it not really that simple it could be that your girlfriend is an isfp sei and that you are duals congratulations if that the case but you cannot use the p conversion for introverts that activation and very common relationship entp esfj there are lot of married couples and friends with this type combination but using the sj category to generalize about relationships is extraverts can be shy nothing strange about that entp know this it is just that these are not good definitions for what we see in real people if we compare all 16 types and how they interact and if we compare different typology systems it a long still it captures the types we see in the real world much better there is problem with mbti it fucks up the functional order for introverts this has never been corrected the se types are in socionics the ego and super id functions are the same in each quadra not the first 4 oh maybe you were talking about the mbti functional order yeah just don mix mbti and socionics it nope the p switch for introverts doesn work it would only work if you assumed that the functional definitions are the same but they aren the relation between mbti and socionics is actually these are all mirror relationships in socionics they are good because they are inside the same quadra but they are not the best partners have similar strengths with slightly different emphasis no this is not correct know there is web site with conversion table of this kind but it is not correct this has been discussed on socionics forums the conversion would only be correct if it tricky to mix mbti and socionics you cannot just switch the p for introverts to get the socionics type actually often the socionics type and mbti type are the same for example am isfp however there are theories that try to predict the development of relationships from type perspective and explain why two so different types as istj and enfj can match perfectly still of course enfj and istj are duals in socionics so provided you have the same types in socionics which you might have then that the perfect match but it can take some time to get used to each other socionics functions have different definitions than in mbti so dont confuse the two fi in socionics is not the same as fi in mbti if you want to know about compatibility between types then this sounds very biased to me to mention logics vs supernatural as the line between f when talking about intellect feelers dont tend to believe in supernatural stuff as opposed to logics what do you mean if you are isfp you cannot have ne but you might have developed ni so you percieve things with se ni maybe you think of it as ne have you read this how to tell intuiting ve left this forum but m just stopping by for while why do you want to know why think am isfp know it from many things they all combined gave me the information needed to socionics has model of intertype relations estp and infp form duality pair best psychological comfort it doesnt say anything about attraction formally mbti types and socionic types are not they have different dominant functions ne and se but they can be easily confused in test there is quite useful article about this problem how to tell intuiting from extraverted sensing many infj have eyes turned downwards like being sad like this think infj eyes look exactly like the functions of their type they radiate fe through layer of ni look at this old thank you for posting this ve been thinking about this too before knew anything about mbti and my type was able to be fake in an innocent way could for example put on an esfj face to just small off topic remark on this never understand what balanced j actually means the four letter code is just short form for the four preferred functions and they are fixed means use linux ubuntu no anti virus and no viruses muahahahah d say stereotypical dominant se confident in ever changing situations

why not well have this intp friend right and she amazing haha everything about her personality is hate libraries with passion or at least most public libraries ve visited few campus libraries and the new york city library while visited ny for like week liked them lot more m usually really relaxed easy going and not very demanding at all m unable to actually raise one specific one got 5w6 with the traditional test but got 9w1 sx with the intellectual variant version which do think makes much more sense as believe mistyped as 5 6 earlier yeah when m pissed or sad usually go to be alone with my thoughts and sometimes ll talk with really close friend of mine she always cheers me up she also the one want to be in mine would be like small building from myst it would be big enough to have place to relax some cool puzzles and workshop and personal library and it would overlook some beautiful scenery feel that the meaning of life isn something we can actually know that it something for every

could don ask anyway we were one of my best friends is an infp not at all know what you mean it can really take it toll m just hoping don become numb to the world like you said as that even worse ve

              " 'i have bad news got really drunk last week and told my istp crush roommate who is his best friend that liked the istp after his roommate had prodded me about boys several times his m back again looks like there aren many responses on this forum nowadays tongue so ve begun to take more initiative with the istp in question because he sort of shy and unreadable if hey m back again it turns out that the istp like also likes me back he asked me to smoke with him more where he asked me for my number and taken me on car rides his best friend also hi istps wanted to ask question about an istp that like in my college he is type 9w8 very emotionally reserved but very straightforward honest and seems to care about the wellbeing of intp typically find them very endearing awkward in way that is adorable to me and not frustrating my deepest crushes have been on intps love how they can see every side to an issue use hard my three best friends right now are istj 6w5 estj 1w2 and estp 8w7 1 2 3 4 5 like the above poster said fe is choice could choose not to engage in it and could imagine what such scenario would look like but to do so would be sort of uncomfortable because i have always had trouble paying attention in school getting motivated to do schoolwork following written and oral directions on tests keeping track of materials getting tests done on time get this is fi infjs can excel at science when they see it as an art art by nature is very intuitive process myself am an aspiring neuroscientist and lot of what know about the brain comes from ve been in relationship with an enfp and an entj they were completely different people and while truly learned lot in those relationships don think d date anyone like them again ve pretty consistently gotten ni fe as my top two and then ne following after have very high ne and it definitely shows which led me to believe that was infp up until few weeks ago my wouldn say it is in born perhaps it was picked up on quicker in some folks for me recognize intentions fairly easily and sometimes will subtly exploit other people that dislike for so am an infj type 4w5 at my university ve had two consistent crushes one is type 5w4 intp and the other is type 1w9 intj they also happen to be the two smartest men ve ever met in my this is most certainly an infj thing do this all the time m sure it is fe thing but ni allows us to be introspective enough to consciously observe ourselves doing it in my life ve met many people that ve liked and gone through multitude of crushes my ex was an entj and pined for him after we broke up was convinced that xntj types were the type for hey guys wanted to post here regarding crush ve had for while this post is super long so don know if people will read it but in case someone does ll post it here m pretty sure my stripedfurball that was so much fun to read m attracted to intjs if could choose my future spouse they most likely be intj but they all seem to be snatched up by esfj types in real life it is kind of absurd my xntj ex dated an m inclined to agree don really like using words like unhealthy and healthy to describe types of people think that typology is used as form of self referencing and it can be my experience having crush or my experience with the types had crushes on looking back to when was younger my crushes were almost exclusively sp types my first two major crushes were this is more of character flaw than an infp trait though m sure that infps and feeling types in general have stronger propensity towards it than other types it is interesting that you people see me the same way as they see you used to have problems with melancholy as well but ve gotten to be in good control of that as ve gotten older my thoughts are usually bit more don think that there is much use to introspection if it is not eventually applied our decisions actions beliefs and interests are all determined via self referencing it is difficult to rydark unapplied introspection is not as useful to someone who values action and observable external progress but it can also be applied see persuasive writing and rhetoric as applied ne is kind of like knee jerk reaction the thoughts we have to an idea are about as formulated as they will get with the information we have have noticed that my ni dom friends often like to power is never derogatory word it is necessary component of life from my experience there is difference in flavor between the power crave and the power another person might crave rydark loved that napolean bonaparte quote shame can put it anywhere myself as don resonate with it power doesn really interest me unless can temporarily use it to gain the attention generally see people as pretty deterministic and easy to understand admire people whom believe to be complex believe that natural complexity stems from years and private higher level don understand how entjs are always able to be on top of things formulating plan staying productive focusing on one thing at time can imagine what that be like on day to day haha aww don worry don really think type differences manifest online to the extent that they do in real life for me when m in the real world it mostly that can really get on the being fi dominant means that you make decisions based off of what is personally relevant to you in other words you are less likely to be interested in something due to external factors than actually feel similarly towards art and consider myself to be 4w5 as well don think that type 4 has to be religiously devoted to art think that that is just stereotype the crux what made you rule out intx why did you end up deciding on infp not saying that you can be an infp but am surprised that you typed yourself as infp given that lot of mbti tests incorrectly am someone who really likes to have defined identity and don really enjoy spending time with people who don have identities of their own throughout my lifetime my little sister younger love xstj types love all xxtj types actually it usually the xsfj types that get under my nerves the esfjs in my life annoy me to no end know believe me know that feeling but interestingly enough didn really crave that before had met my entj ex for me had always been interested in guys for their strengths and threads like these are interesting don think you can find specific types of people in specific type of place she may love to read but she can read in the library just as easily as she can this relationship reminds me lot of past relationship with my ex he is an entj and am an infp yet the dynamics were extremely similar to your own relationship think that there is m 20 my life is awesome love myself people sense that and they want to be near me inspire people because m so happy and put together wouldn say that my te is well developed though agreed with wulfex also like the dynamic programming analogy to be honest don see ti anywhere in your first post ti is to the point and weeds things out you listed bunch of bullet hard to say without context the best scenario is one in which the intensity is maintained yet without the polar extremes e no depressive sadness infps make decisions based on how topic ve dated enfps isfps and entjs in order of how excited was about each relationship my ordering would be from least to most isfp then enfp then entj my crushes tend to be intj this vesper007 perhaps but highly doubt the booty call thing his sex drive is was pretty low when we were together and this was something he had expressed concern about since mine was higher m math minor and m an infp my experience with math has been up and down so you might find it useful to read about was pretty good at math when was little probably the best in my so in so many words you re describing situation in which you have to lead people who do not seem responsive or motivated to move forth in the effective direction fear that the problem will is it mask per se or is it that we tend to be hyperattuned to the discrepancy between our thoughts feelings and our actions because while do not consider myself to be authentic with every this thread was definitely worth the time it took you to post it my only concern is that you provided too much information about this guy luckily with all the context you ve provided us with m the first step is to stop determining your self worth based on the results of some sliding scale personality test and to look at yourself from completely objective standpoint you are not ',\n",

accurate online iq test which was told by psychologist that performs iq tests with his patients that this is fairly acurate iq test think people with large intellectual egos have difficult time when someone disagrees with them or tells them they are wrong don think you can change something like that you can try to be more objective suppose it the way your brain processes things felt that way in

because it interesting and compared to anatomy the styles of the classes are night and day there a thing yes that very true ve often wondered that myself besides intj is not supposed to mean you re sociopath although have to admit when first found these personality tests played into that fear of complete failure lol whoops wrong forum became more open minded logical little more sequential ambitious driven responsible skeptikal self assured confident less critical of myself more informed more self esteem more m heteromantic and bisexual can see the woman thing being long term besides it something keep to myself and haven told any one m obsessed with my teeth it depends on how good of friend it is most people guess would but would also think would that person do the same thing for me if the answer is no then might not go ve been in the when you judge people harshly when your an eternal skeptik when people always tell you you re too strict when people have hard time meeting your expectations you re pessimist maybe those hate talking on the phone because it boring would rather talk in person there is no connection through texting ppl drain me but d still rather be in person

totally had no idea started this thread when commented on it for real so weird don remember starting this think it was january 15 know so long ago was supposed to have sleepover with my best friend we had all these issues with drama last yea and thought we finally understood eachother and thanks for the insight was wondering if some of the text was hard to read tried to use neon colors but apparently that didnt work too well im not sure if its gonna be diary type thing or just created blog it at mollypaget blogspot com just started it today so it not much but just wanted to put it out there right now its kind of an introduction thing but plan to make reindesu it like you re describing me elementary school loved it was the sweet shy smart girl loved my teachers had really really high reading level subjects were easy to me mylifeisaverage com you sound cool am 17 and virgin because believe in waiting until marriage to have sex my belief is that sex is for marriage and loving marriage at that my family is going to disneyland in february d this wil be the second time going there and the second time ever going on plane so big deal thanks for this thread really needed to yeah it like make myself hyperaware of how look and act because naturally m kind of unaware of stuff my natural tendency to not notice stuff combined with my self consciousness makes me this story of my life man automatically back away when someone is standing too close to me and do not like it when someone tries to rub me or something creepy like that my mom tries all the 16 like this age 17 sounds all old and weird no offense 17 makes me think of really tall girls 16 can still be small and cute im gonna be 17 on decebmer 22 its too soon scored 10 took the test to se how well it worked im sure dont have autism or anything and thats what the test told me so its probably pretty good also this is probably not very good am attracted to the enfp type but also think need t man but dont really want an entp i need and it really depends on the person with e maybe non shy introvert am shy this is totally me ever since could talk anyone besides family will not call thank the lord for texting everyone started getting it around when was in 7th grade so perfect timing yeah feel like part of the reason that happens to me so often is that force myself to be extraverted naturally want to process things before say that but have kind of trained myself to best friend enfj we became friends nearly instantly when we met in 3rd grade and we are closer than ever now in 11th have an old friend who think is infj we were really close until the was really good at school in elementary school like started reading really early and was always at higher levels than the rest of my class until hit junior high in 7th grade it was really you ll be in my heart by phil collins from the tarzan soundtrack yeah know awesomeness love this love how awkward you all are reminds me of myself hahaha want to make one but would want to do it when im home alone so my family doesnt think im talking to myself in my thought this would be interesting to hear about from infps because we probably cry more than other people think do and cry about the most random stuff and sometimes dont cry when think what do you think of your body is your body just something that gets your head around places or something more do you like sports or any activities of the sort if you were completely yeah actually dont even try to or realize im doing it notice that around my family the people am most comfortable with am more myself than with anyone else the less know the person constant 24 7 talking that sounds like way too much for an introvert this guy ive recently become closer friends with has been texting me every morning and expects the conversation to last all day yeah well really its my mom and have major issue with it she thinks am totally insane that resist to her touching me and rubbing me all over find touching very sexual so its extremely you ve already told me that same story like 5 times stop being so crabby when im perfectly fine except when she says that my mood goes wayyy down because hate false accusations hahaha hmm the istj that know is math genius particularly algebra whoever said that they heard ns were supposed to be good at math im really surprised ive heard the opposite ive heard that we are generally extremely loyal love being loyal it makes me feel really happy and satisfied basically my biggest dream in life is to get married cant even understand people that cant handle yeah when im unhappy having bad month or something get really extra introverted and then get more depressed feeling and its downward spiral it seems weird to me that when im happiest my original thought was for sure but then thought about whether id rather hang out with someone who was sf or nt and went with sf generally if its what letter like about myself the most hahaha so do this another thing ive recently picked up doing is when cant find the right word to describe something ill just replace the space with doodleydoo or some gibberish like that or yes agree with all that been said feel like my family or friends just go day by day like theyre on mission to get things done or be really social and stuff that seems like the opposite of haha im thinking shouldn have forced fixed number on this list it was hard enough for me to pick just five and made the darn thread haha wanna add some more glee veronica mars feel like have purpose in life even though dont have much of an idea what it is yet its very comforting to me to know that god is watching over me and cares and has plan for me don in no particular order friends gilmore girls the office buffy the vampire slayer bewitched dont think can explain this one so hard to pick how about you guys did anyone ever play kindgom hearts loved that sims 3 vmk no one has like ever heard of it but it was awesome it was on the internet was cooler on that game than real life let face it am hotter than you are jacob black to edward cullen eclipse taylor lautner ftw dont worry im not twilighter just happen to think taylor launter is amazing think youll find being sensitive will attract the best kind of girls the sweeties who want to be treated nicely and see you as kind of guy who will be nice to them think girls find they lefties ftw oh good was looking for this kind of thread ive been wondering the same thing this istj guy liked me for while but it didnt happen because wasnt interested long story but now months later hufflepuff probably but think have hints of gryffindor in me too dont particularly value hard work or fair play though guess hard work is good thing in general usually just not on my yeah do that all the time usually its like conversation already had that wish had done differently so redo it kind of in my mind or its conversation im planning on having that type m 16 right now lot of the time just don even know what to feel or what am feeling but feel strongly when do moved to where live now when was 9 and made two friends right talk to imanimate objects they are usually called he ll like get knife out of drawer to use and be like oh hi how are you today you re gonna have some fun being buttered or something yes as kid video games were one of my main activities pc games and playstation was what we had so did that all the time but once turned maybe 13 14 did it lot less often even am the one who will stare at the sunset for the full 20 or so minutes thinking huge thoughts about life and earth beauty and then someone will walk by and go absentmindedly oh the sun is you should read all the personality profiles as opposed to just taking the test its more clear way to see what you are thats what do when im trying to type others that cant really figure out basically everything do reaffirms that am infp and sometimes when act like other types see how that could have manifested in my infpness ie sometimes get really organized but it is when trying to describe something will use words like doodleydoo and other gibberish sound effects as replacements for long descriptions because feel like people should already know what am im 16 and ive never even had kiss or boyfriend im waiting till marriage to have sex because im christian and thats what believe even if wasnt an infp would feel this way but probably ',\n",

getting laid when you have six plans for something mundane and do none of them when you feel that even victory is anti climactic cus you can play anymore ofc the ego stroke is some consolation though when when you re in room that is so clean it puts you on edge when people assume you re either thinking or daydreaming because you re staring into space but in actuality you re not using your internal monologue and you re not picturing or remembering anything you know exactly what you mean but don elaborate it correctly and people assume you re moron but then you rise to the occasion cus you tune into the level of conversation and usually manage to just replied to minx the commenter above your last response in this thread with what is essentially my response to you also m trying to get better picture of ni so my response here may have taking ni into consideration and considering the inward directed nature of it it contributes largely to the overall picture you generate and work with ne in contrast entp is very divergent and m unsure as to how exactly it manifests and m sure you as an intj having experienced this first hand can make much more informed statement about the motivating factors my description was lol yeah got far too hyped up there gotta watch out for entp entp interactions lol dunno if can even sleep now my minds racing like my intuitions doing mad shit in the background you know m not actually saying there is no forest but there are trees m saying that the differentiation only makes sense descriptively we are using language to understand this language is flawed our conscious experience is an illusion that we have constant awareness of the subconscious is non illusory part of our existence we are not constantly aware of hence the differentiation you omg under stimulationing that made my day i pretty sure he was trying to say deduction vs induction but kinda fucked it up lol edit plus he just wrong on half of what he saying baaaad generalizations going on philosophy birthed science and gave it it concepts and methodology science is still branch of philosophy areas like epistemology the theory of knowledge go further than science in defining aww m utterly gutted that this question is just another monism dualism debate so m just gonna answer the question that entitles the post as presumed it meant the subconscious mind is most m not overly fond of this definition it all trends and evidence based statements feel it misses the nature of ti somehow definitely written by te user don get me wrong everything it make people uncomfortable for many reasons being smart is one of them lol the others include my absolute refusal to follow anybody else codes of conduct not standing on ceremony my tendency be cute and interesting stroke my ego little or anything else you like then ignore me little but not so much that categorize you as lost cause or alternatively just walk up to me and how do entps engage in conversation with complete strangers randomly interchange between being ridiculously friendly or very cold depending on mood on different days say lots of interesting meditation annoys the crap out of me because it directly going against what my brain wants to do it makes me super zen for an hour or so but then get ridiculously bored of being so at peace with in my experience with my intp buddies and my intj nemeses intp are much more objective and accurate about pretty much everything assuming they have really thought it through which ninety percent of lol do all but the last two plus get narcissistic and delude myself somewhat even though know on some level the entire time m full of shit when m alone and can think properly entp need 538393 my stereotypical entp smirk 538401 and of course the famous death stare 1 everyone is equal but responsible for carving themselves slice of the pie 2 never hate anyone you likely don have good enough reason and regardless it only serves to give them power 3 when you say stoicism do you mean true stoicism or are you using it colloquially like spartan for example if you mean it exactly then no m not really stoic acknowledge emotions as an yeah just did cognitive functions test and it confirmed that m more intp thanks it was socionics that confused me in the first place thanks yeah think intps more likely really good input in regards to the energised or drained by prolonged social interaction it is tough one around my best friends can be fine with being well am very undecided both ti and ne are strongly developed either way but can help obssessing over this need some damn closure need time to myself and need time around other think ve felt love but m far too skeptical to assume that that was what it was believe love is just extreme attatchment combined with healthy dosage of delusion don get me wrong then forget my every word went slightly crusader too used to idiots randomly insulting people online didn think that you were specifically referring to me but thought that that was one hell of ballsy quote to go chucking into the middle of an intellectual debate all of my digressions come wow you re pretty damn funny you re making some grandiose assumptions here you know sweet fuck all about me and are generalising about all thinking types emotion is at the root of everything charming trully charming knew you were feeling type before checked also knew you were judging type might be worth your while to have some respect for people who process the world in see what you mean we re talking about it in relative to other human experiences sense in which case agree entirely it has the same validity as say happiness but imo remains just another find it an unusual conclusion to come to that human experience can be anything other than illusion care to elaborate you spend three days driving yourself mad by stressing out as to whether your intp or entp and then come to the conclusion that you re intp based on what you were aware of at the start of the three you absolute legend it actually looks amazing as well plus just read few strings from their forum and even though think somewhat disjointedly that is something else entirely very highly developed intuition and tendancy towards not thinking things through entirely say whatever want get to the point really quickly m pro at manipulation etc all of these think might be an entp shocked might start using socionics instead well really the first time wasn messing with you it was when told you that was messing with you that was messing with you proud it fine don care

though he may be great with sensing what around him but when it comes down to it his ability to recognize patterns and analyze data make him an don think it a bad thing feel something towards it but don think that as important as understanding that this is fundamentally wrong maybe it doesn inspire you but does it how many sjs does it take to change light bulb umm one how many sjs does it take to change light bulb change do we have to how many infjs does it take to change light bulb for me the hardest thing to accept as rational woman it okay to be in the majority who knew right was tomboy for few years before realized that in my zealous pursuit of know entps are supposed to be good with this but sure as hell am not become irritated when people give me that kick under the table look cough enfjs cough cough like m saying bones is an intj believe at times she is very sensory and does indeed have trouble with metaphors but she has very nt ish desire to know the truth although she admits that she is not okay so ve searched far and wide for anything anyone that tried to type characters in the book musical wicked and found nothing so ve decided to post thread is anyone else completely out so ve been somewhat obsessed with this book since ve been reading it in english and ve been attempting to myers briggs type the characters so here what ve come up with so far jane my opinion as an xntp intps have tendency to be too harsh and judgmental so this can lead to conflict with other personalities especially feelers but intps who have grown up around esfjs jesus christ is an entp no no way that mental if someone could type jesus and you probably can he be an xnfj anywho my personal favorite real one is walt disney and my favorite seriously though we upstage pretty much every other type funny talented smart versatile witty charming and let not forget modest so everyone post one reason why we re just so thank you all for your suggestions they helped lot and really appreciate them my best friend is an infj honestly couldn ask for more loyal trustworthy and amazing friend but sometimes it difficult for me to understand her naturally feel the need to break the think scarlett more of an estj don think she p because she very much planner and although she can improvise she prefers to stick with plan here an idea journalism 1 it takes good writing skills but there no need to come up with cheesy dialogue 2 each story only takes few days to write so there are no long term oh and my favorite entp of all time is jo from little women and the cheshire cat of course don think so one would hardly describe him as being curious although he can definitely improvise and has quick wit m pretty sure he an estp actually if you look at the description have to say think of hermoine as intj through and through though she becomes more extroverted throughout the series she a very good problem solver and likes to think outside the box to you know you re an entp when you laugh before everyone else and they all think you re crazy but what do you care you re far more intelligent than they are you argued with your second grade when m with another introvert usually talk more esp with my best friend whom mentioned early on is an infj usually school is the place where feel most extroverted m one of those haha knew something like that would happen as for your question it really depends on the situation there have been multiple times at school when ve had diarrhea of the mouth and have said the ntp descriptions describe me quite well but once had few ish tendencies when was little was sometimes impulsive and made few choices based on my feelings but only when felt on second thought take back what said about clarity since m always correcting spelling grammar 1 emotions probably although it hard to say since many of my friends and family are very fi and ve gotten better at relating to them 2 clarity definitely 3 tell my ideas to others know m not an enfp make decisions based on logic and don think that m too young to figure it out though personalities can change ve read that about 95 of it is obvious by the time hmm okay then spend lot of time alone in my room doing research on different things reading or just thinking about different things with my close friends m always eager to share my hey guys okay m fourteen years old and know that m either entp

read those books she sounds like an intj to me just one that probably learned not to be very controlling always thought j was entp but maybe just want him to be like me scout seems enfp in the book but since she was based on harper lee herself she probably infp aunt alexandra esfj believe boo radley seems to be isfp to me other than that you re pretty am the only one who thinks enxp say since she seems to be keeping things open as ve heard her say in interviews and has also said that she enjoys school but isn obsessed like hermione could it be blinks an interesting hero who isn f what more is intp sorry m an animated kids movies fan and the main characters are always glares at disney apparently disney pixar doesn like the ntp i love singing my voice is quite good if do say so myself so it is something that comes naturally find it very therapeutic and it releases lot of stress don cry very often but when my grandmother is entj and she and relate quite well she is great story teller and has very sarcastic sense of humor although she can sometimes be overly critical or harsh it part of her ',\n",
              " ' oh you have to also consider all the other planets and not just your sun sign like you could have your sun in libra but the other planets might not be in libra plus your exact time of birth m so envious m going there at the end of the year to see the northern lights haha yes which is probably good thing since m so disorganised and all we actually had conference and presented our research on the countries that we were allocated o yes agree with yeah the people m going with are all s haha so they are pretty pedantic about planning this trip that why we decided to do our own planning and not go with tour but it so much work m going towards the end of the year we are planning everything by ourselves which is proving to be quite frustrating if you want to do it cheaply there are tours that you can take like wow thanks that makes perfect sense as an fi user can understand this and should be able to see where this is coming from in the past would ve ignored this completely because the feelings thanks for the advice guess it up to me to resolve this issue since it doesn seem he keen to do anything about it ahh can see what you mean both enfps and infps have tendency to idealise the person however with this guy we knew each other reasonably well even in the short time we were friends and we both thanks yeah think that exactly what happened he told my friend that he felt that didn seem to reciprocate why didn you just ask her out sooner did you need to be certain that she thanks for the explanation ll take this as advice regardless believed that it was worth it but he didn know did think he was scared and tried to indicate that was scared too though thank you for this advice now know how dangerous it is he was very flirty and his words seemed so sincere saying how special am to him that he could see us together in the future until we true perhaps the problem was that he didn like me enough hi enfps some questions so can understand this situation had an enfp guy become interested in me and we were doing this dance for few months apparently he couldn tell if liked him or sleeping at last birdcage religion so slowly m losing who ve sworn to be promise in pencil that years have made so hard to read ve spent my life building walls brick by brick and hi could get my name changed to snaeha please thanks in advance thanks for the advice ve resolved to tell him how feel hopefully it will go well and hopefully don chicken out just wanted to thank everyone for their very insightful replies yeah think he is confused about my actions perhaps do appear hot and cold sometimes though ve been pretty lol wait is this advice for me m female and yes we are very mature over 20 year olds let just say he didn tell me that he was ready asked if he was over his ex and he gave vague answer no definite yes more like confusing answer that to me reads no though as an infp thanks for the responses guys think straight forward is the way to go but how about if we added another factor say the girl thought the guy wasn over his ex though he says that he ready to this question is mostly directed to enfp males but some insight from enfp females would be appreciated too say there was girl you were interested in and you were unsure of how she felt about the funny thing is even though he attached now he still treats me the same way m not sure if this is diversion for other people or he just jerk no worries like learning about thanks for the insight into intps guys m still unsure if he is one though if anyone is following and wanted to know the outcome to this whole thing the mutual friend was interested in him for haha thought you guys didn place significance on looks thought it was more mind connection hahaha could never do this and think can imagine his reaction thanks for the replies guys but think my feelings for him have near gone away just realised this when felt that maybe interesting guess it true about the comfort thing we might probably just be best staying friends m happy with that the enfp was talking about earlier they don really get along yeah know he tells me stuff when he ready try not to pry but sometimes just get the feeling that he wants me to ask was talking about mutual male friend to him he commented that that friend and were talking to each other quite lot then asked him if he thought that friend and were similar he then don really understand what you re trying to say have tried to understand him my attempts have been rejected ve told him that care about him and he seems to open up bit more is it possible that long term relationship could ve softened him bit he won confirm his type and likes that he hard to read manipulative no thanks so much this was very helpful ok m confused think he flirts with us equally to the same degree with all three of us together probably with her more since she quite extroverted bring in some other people he flirts with thank you for the insight re the bolded yes that is so true hate that little bit of hope that eats at me thanks for answering think act in the same manner for some reason do thanks ll take note of that everything helps yeah that makes sense which means you ve never furthered relationship into something serious with someone who was initially close friend do intps prefer being friends first before getting think isfps are more guarded than infps ve known my isfp friend think she an isfp for nearly 2 years now and still don feel like we re close however it could be because m not m curious why is that think he could be very introverted entp know he says things to gauge my reaction he also asks me questions that he already knows the answer to he says he interesting that makes lot of sense actually yeah m formulating scenario in my head to try to figure this out will ask him when have the chance thank you think this is exactly what needed someone to say to me there are better guys out there definitely would there be reason for telling me that he liked her would think thanks hate games think the best thing for me is to set some boundaries or something thanks for the replies guys appreciated thinking about this more he flirts less when we are alone together flirts more if there are other people around when we are alone he more serious yeah sure no he is flirty even when she not around before he was bit flirty with her too but for some reason haven seen him interact with her in that way for while was bit firstly my friend is probably low on the or so he says so he may be borderline entp if that makes difference few weeks ago he told me very unexpectedly that he was interested in our thanks ll take look hmm why do you say that is it because said he was very adventurous in the physical sense that what lead me to believe that he may be an istp or estp but he not sure about the explaining thing all know is that he good at explaining things than am or more that understand what he trying to explain but yes he does try to finish other people hehe yeah figured you meant that so there aren many artistic entps then my friend seems to place some importance on the meaning behind the art but then again would see piece of art and not even auditory art e music thanks everyone appreciate it was considering enfj for while though he doesn seem like he has very high he definitely makes decisions in logical hi all m having trouble figuring out my friend type apparently he entp made him take the test though before he did the test would never have thought he was entp was thinking more

always wear my wedding rings they re removed for cleaning the house wear earrings every day and do make an effort to wear bracelets and necklaces sometimes get lazy and don don m genuinely nice and kind person ve learned people are scared off by generosity it like seriously people m actually helpful we live in world of take and take and when people see oh m also programmer don know what the issue is my current supervisor spends most of his time giving me help didn ask for and then berates me loudly like m an incompetent please allow me few sentences to vent am once again experiencing issues with people in the work world this is my 5th company in the last 10 years where it appears can go through life unfortunately this company is not place want to stay with the environment is not place for people who have ideas on implementing efficient processes m looking for new job at any rate as programmer software developer thought this discussion was interesting m starting to rethink some of my own ideas about what am interested in and can do and figured d share i a little late in responding updating but you are right ve come to realize that while my employer is one place m experiencing this issue overall in life there are going to be people sometimes when get extremely frustrated with situation and seek to devise or find solution come across another roadblock it seems lot of these roadblocks exist because many things happen now you ve lost me believe that called hunting their prey you know what sucks when it a cultural practice to be late in my cultural background it normal for people to not show up for wedding until half an hour or an hour late at wedding how would you know they are or aren an istj m seriously getting sick of seeing people who are convinced they know what the mbti is of people they don know the next question will be why are istjs so uptight not sleeping yet have degree in comp sci programming looking to get into an it position in my experience dressing up nice or conservatively has been the least of my concerns like dressing up whether it business casual or more conservative never had an issue wearing heels making hear you there are an awful lot of horror stories about istj mothers my own mother is nuts but sincerely doubt she is an istj since she is so extroverted and jumps to her emotional states i was told was sweet hearted child who was shy but could keep myself entertained and never needed hand holding to find something to do didn like chores of course but liked books naturally bonding with people can be difficult too know lot of people just don find me likable even though often hear that have the qualities of likable person that why don well it would be start when you say interview company how do you go about that just setting up meeting that how it went for me and after while gave up too ve nearly given up as it is right now but am choosing to just focus on the things want to focus on m lot happier when don make bump in the night keep in mind the point of obtaining an education is to result in an employable position after graduation that means your degree and experience must reflect that instead of thinking about what to think it best to see the workplace as the area in your life where you do something productive in exchange for money what you do to be productive is up to you but it should be something where that called making friends and for lot of us other people just don like our flow to which say they can go down with the tsunami if my supervisor supervisor supervisor basically an executive did not think they were big deal that tells me they weren a big deal especially if the supervisor was talked to and was asked here the deal don think m asking for lot out of job just want job where can go in do my work and leave don think m entitled to special perks or treatment don even ve had difficulty almost my entire life when you move around bit as child and teenager it makes it difficult to make friends especially if you re ugly as hell know it sounds mean but m it always more refreshing to get yawns than rotten tomatoes or pitchforks and torches thought it was run from us lol not if they re tempurpedic those things last forever swear and are oh so soft with the best alignment thinks of robbing husband pillow husband is an okay so am going to be pain here but have to ask this what is up with the questions about so many problematic istjs in people lives and people somehow being so sure the problem person is an oh yeah can appreciate that as well but sometimes it nice not to lay one head on concrete block all the time and enjoy the seemingly weightless pillowy softness of abstraction don find socializing despicable just stupid people despicable or being told that all people belong in boxes now that a yawn for me told some people this weekend that don like people while was hanging out with people sips tea oh have to agree here even my husband is sometimes surprised by my emotional fervor he never sees it coming lol apparently depending on the context and your sex it can make you appear mysterious as well friend from school thought befriending me was the most interesting experience before term started uh found it interesting like talking about philosophy if it in the right context when people try to talk philosophy when it should be about government find it pointless it simple yes many wish for what we should be and many are disappointed lol think istjs could go this deep but let be honest here we won go this deep if we don know you and don think you actually ve thought about taking break from life but not disappearing completely coworker once told me she took break from life asked her how she did it as the concept seemed strange to me apparently being an introvert who likes to socialize with people yet is misanthrope is weirdo news flash for me confused m getting older and began to realize don gaf about who you know this question has come up quite bit over the last two years also have lot of experiencing working with aspie kids so ll give it stab don think istj can necessarily be m trying to understand why school would think they can supersede parental authority by enacting this kind of discipline themselves ',\n",

on my art course start out with clear idea of what they want to do and then move towards it m pretty much apathetic towards my end m intp and you strike me as being one of us can relate to all your replies tried being in relationship with an infp and an infj and found their seeming irrationality to be incredibly frustrating at times it nice to be with another intp like me now he very we were together for three years and we are still good friends but the relationship didn work out in the end he is an infp and found his dominant fi tiresome he would just complain all the believe that my dad is an istj as is one of my close friends and think understand them quite well though don think they really understand me they are very loyal structured people forget to eat and end up eating at irregular times but totally love food chocolate is the greatest thing it a good question d say that it manipulating when there an element of disguising or misrepresenting your intentions or the truth don feel comfortable unless know the person who touching me know why they re touching me and they have my consent to touch me rarely initiate physical contact unless have good my ex boyfriend is an infj who has admitted to being good at manipulating people know that he manipulated me on occasions it angered me when initially realised he was manipulating me but have an intj friend who suspect might be sociopath however previously had another intj friend that assumed to be sociopath but when got to know him better it turned out that he was stayed up all night because lost track of time crap intps are pretty good to live with except for the way that many of us tend to forget or procrastinate practical things such as washing up yes hate advertising and consumerism have adblock installed never watch television look away from advertisements spend relatively little compared to most of my friends if enjoy writing m mostly interested in the general concept or focusing on specific word structural choices m not all that interested in plot or character as result tend to write lot of gah feelings make them stop while was at school thought hated maths though still did pretty well at it just about managed to get an in my gcse maths in the end as soon as stopped taking it at school i don think so how are you defining strategy and tactics as understand it strategy and tactics are similar things just on different level strategy is about planning on broad recently ve become lot more confident so increasingly find that people mistake me for an extravert some people even look to me for leadership people also think that m not thinking about yes we can form strategies very well si allows us to take in information about situation which ti analyses then we use ne to come up with possible responses and ti in order to figure out which it not alcohol it to do with couple of social factors firstly people tend to have particular idea of what introverts are like socially withdrawn avoiding all social contact etc agree with you in an argument very rarely choose to claim to have any authority on topic and prefer to have discussions than arguments with that in mind think my embarrassment in that thinking about it ought to have expanded to include that my intp boyfriend hates rts games but loves dota 2 whereas love rts games but dislike mobas however all the intps know know many intp descriptions make some mention of shared intp ideal of truth for most of my life have found this to be the case throughout childhood all really cared about was learning have enjoy assassin creed but would say that if anything suspect that sensing types would benefit from it more they are visual and aural spectacle but the game combat mechanics lack depth like little bit of small talk as way of easing into conversation have few friends who take the attitude hate small talk therefore am going to delve immediately into deeper on the face of it this seems to make sense but think that circumstances complicate things bit believe that my calling is to be an artist it part of who am when m given space here the problem my financial situation for the next two years of my degree is looking uncertain things have been fine this year but since my household income has increased above certain the impression get is that mbti relationships pages always recommend your shadow type suppose the logic is something along the lines of opposites attract you cover each other weaknesses who do you want to be night time walks seem to be thing for lot of introverts few of my close

school you might find it helpful to talk to some of your teachers about the problems you are having yes everything gets to me pretty easily though primarily process things on an analytical level it only occasionally penetrates me on an emotional level feel that have to be as genuine as d be curious to hear about how you ve all matured over the years what you were like as child adolescent and adult how have your functions changed and manifested how have your lesser functions am definitely an intp and share most of those things with you the article links to some pretty dubious looking sources don understand where these numbers come from didn buy anything in the sales there wasn anything really wanted or needed however did buy risk and pack of cards at my campus charity shop there were no sales but stuff is always thank you for your thoughtful response think it made sense there one thing just don quite understand why is there this keenness to ensure nothing much gets through the barrier to the usually come out as intp identify strongly with inxp but have strong is it possible that might be pretty much halfway between intp and infp when first discovered the test when firstly thanks to everyone for taking the time to reply types are great m used to living with js though so generally keep to good standard of organisation and tidiness keeping primarily draw and paint also write poetry and prose compared to other intps ve met m more of an artist than scientist was deprived of proper scientific education sadly and m better at articulating my feelings how do you seem to some intjs and occasionally other intps depending on how developed their fe is 44 intellectual 36 creative 20 caregiver m an art student and not particularly strongly so it adds up find it difficult to tell when my intj friend is drunk he maintains his composure and intellect but just gradually becomes bit more confused and forgetful until it reaches the point that he is m an intp in my first year at university have an intj friend who am considering living with during my second year the thing is that he is unpopular with most people due to his lack of social love is strong attachment that has developed into commitment the emotions involved within love are not sufficient alone to constitute love love is not something you have right to merely no people have said m friendly and even charismatic which didn understand at all but nobody said have good people skills ',\n",

issue for this pair is negotiating the intimate relationship the intensity of the one to ones can feel demanding even overwhelming to their self pres partners it not that when you don realize that thinkers can have all these same feelings too honestly this thread is upsetting typical enfp at party mingling with an infj plus mr unknown personality all in one breath remember the scene when niles changed his mind about finding out if daphne is an official psychic or not they hired the psychiatrist from univ of seattle but niles didn want to know the hey what up you re supposed to be an fi must

product of creative moment and the wrinkles weren ironed out yet if you had more powerful ni yes agree so if person is begging for words and we feel wordless then perhaps they want sympathetic words

lillith is always impeccably you re right roz is probably thinker maybe estj my first guess on lillith an intj she and niles clash so much they hate each other but then they wind up in bed together so

friends in this example so if your friend thinks it okay for person to cheat on person you re saying that you be irritated with your friend for you walked out of the room hate confrontation hmmmm intj are more comfortable with confrontation compared to other types to me this sounds like an infp moment your concerns about not sure if that a gut instinct on knowing what to do with the computer your reaction was based on the power of reason and logic because of your past experiences with computers right so in fact ve done lot of reading the past two days of things wrote when was younger and was definitely feeler as child and adolescent m not convinced that whatever you thinkers spontaneously tend to critique feelers spontaneously appreciate you suggested that your isfp sister work on her pitch that comment was so spontaneous it makes me think you re an leave it to an infp to get the characters mixed up um it wasn the cat who was communicating it was female intp humanoid but hey if you want to argue with cat infp go ahead sex in the city or idiot guide to sex this cracked me up cuz m an infj and feel the same way why bother with an esfp maybe if we teamed up against the esfp nah m busy looking for my overdue library hey you re smart female istj as we women can only hope that male isfps will shave once in while so what about male istjs out there do you all shave everyday at 6 12 m for exactly emotional sarcastic dig must be an nf oh look it is ok ya got me hee hee will be planning flagrant act of revenge on killingbunnies stay tuned the next time you post pounce so whatcha doin now looking up flagrant in actually intj am not trying to be pseudo intellectual rather am truly intellectual ah it heavenly to be so smart so what you problem intj what exactly are you disturbed ha an infp criticizing all of us sarcastically to fellow infp uh oh the infp are ganging up on us typical enfp she must butt in and laugh her ass off but it really disguise to keep it friendly because she doesn think we can handle the criticism but we can yeah it not bad thing for you anyway you couldn even decide which enfp porn freak you prefer too many options for ya entp brain freeze you wouldn do anything ha hey intp okay will join the real world for moment and will tell my intp husband to join the real world with me wait minute where is he god he was reading the word of the intp how many dictionaries did you consult before finally selecting your amazingly accurate definition of visionary um by the way you were supposed to criticize the previous poster in yeah it is our territory esfp but that doesn stop the entps from competing with us you know that of course if you stopped dusting off your cute nic nacs and trophies and maybe read yes ve been contemplating major life change the final decision has to be mine if close relatives try to sway me in one direction rebel and sway in the opposite direction however hey infp you re telling an intp to stop underestimating your ability to finish poetry so tell me what do you know about estimation analytics statistical models for predicting outcomes that because you re still creating model for your type in due time you will be writing down all the specific insults for any intp and it will be perfect list as long as you keep ah clever so you infp do think sometimes then huh wonder if your isfp sister is just using the verb doing since she is doer type maybe she relates more to action verbs is she really trying to say hey what up maybe she wants to so you just formed an intp clique for yourself then ha how insecure is that come on ya can find the guy istj get an estp to help you nail him gosh even spotted him snowbird lol owfin was indeed having fun you see chimeric we introverts know how to have fun without people in the room ruining the moment try it sometime why do you need other ep for fun misconception no probably just misinterpreted the intended use of the word dictate in the original post oh is that what you meant okay about your love for sarcasm that was my fe at work m inclined to say you re an infj also could have given the same responses to many of these questions particularly 20 also pace and talk to myself more openly but never why not your first thought that he intp my husband is intp and he is grounded with reality and details he also loves to write science fiction and he watches science fiction movies on tv hi ve been on fence lately over an infj or intj thing ve got the nailed thank god my only thought about your post is that if you truly think your personality type doesn dictate hi this is bothering me because for the past 12 years thought was intj and then gradually began to doubt myself and m fidgeting with infj for the past year it a rude awakening to ',\n",

someone keeps pushing my buttons slip into liar mode d tell myself stories in the toilet to keep myself entertained when didn have any books on hand they last for up to half an hour or more wished had that same brainstorming for now xd usually keep eye contact with people when m talking from learning that it necessary for speech in school and also to let them know that m listening though do this

mellow m still kind of young for any relationships still in college equivalent of education don find being lonely problem in fact think it great though with my friends it sometimes sanity what that cool would say it depends on the type of people and what they say in my case from being around lot of strong opinionated people it good to hear what they think and m accepting to their to me haven been around too much of the groups that do the superficial girl talk lot discussing what people are wearing judging them based on their clothes and their attitude things used to look forward to going to the tertiary institution that wanted to go because viewed it as starting over new life after spending over ten years in the same school here and also you re the nicest person ve ever met it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside blushed although have been told that m too nice xd you re good at writing are you still writing i have friends who say they know people who are infj it has happened twice already xd haven met one personally wish did crying ve started noticing this after while when would try to find more about the person and leaving them almost no information about myself than the basic things people would know about strangers istjs and enfps direct opposites of each other xd haven found any infj friends in real life yet though although keep hearing about them through other friends have about 4 friends that would consider quite close then another tier for good friends and then followed by the everyone is equal tier if had to choose between taking the time to when first came across mbti felt like it explained quite lot about myself didn really see myself as rare at first just that oh an explanation that needed for why act so and so can act well tried helping one of my friends out once with their film project and ended up getting booted because didn know the other actor well we were supposed to be best friends ouch keep crashing into stuff okay how do get out of the clouds in here it so thick letter by letter if say it out loud but if m thinking about it just use an image with the letters laughing don really mind being alone sometimes but not for extended periods of time probably just enough to recharge the proverbial batteries and then try to go back to socializing the worst there was once when wanted to wash something nearly put toothpaste instead of detergent powder xd but was absent minded all the time in the past usually had my head in the clouds so in terms of maturity d say have matured quite lot than my peers because of the experiences from young mainly because of some verbal bullying involved when was young and the fact that my have nights where just can fall asleep until about 4am or so just tossing or turning in bed so on those days use the valuable time to think never really think lot before sleep hellos and welcome kitteh hope you are able to settle in well at your new city m sure you ll be able to find people to relate to after while to an extent think that time is quite important in friendship mainly the time spent together and sharing about each other can spend lot of time knowing friend but not exactly feeling it the same for me as well friends and strangers tend to gravitate towards me whenever they want listening ear or advice from me or just someone to talk to and share their interests and hobbies am pretty okay with memory but only when associate pictures and images to it so it makes it more colourful also tend to put the information in sing song manner to remember it and only used to splurge on notebooks all the time when was young frustrating and used to splurge on some books too until started regretting it m quite cautious of where ll spend my money on usually d sort of predict what my friends or family would say next before they said it on daily basis they tend to get stuck in the middle of our conversation thinking of what to say so encouraging myself or talking about it with close person other times just watch our family dog do funny stuff like run around the house at breakneck speed and not break anything chase pterodactyl 1w9 5w6 2w1 so sx geoffrey 9w1 2w3 7w6 sx so

kicked into corner into little ball sometimes it entirely off the bed or the pillow somehow fell down during being totally engrossed in reading and writing which makes me feel most alive blushed having people understand and accept me for who am and not try to change me when you can appreciate can relate with most of what you are feeling about being complete pacifist m entirely neutral and refuse to take part in any arguments over anything and always say think maybe it takes lot to anger me but it usually falls under 1 being isolated from others on purpose 2 having to deal with extremely stubborn people who might as well be made of stone 3 when you are playing the piano and reading the score sheet all of sudden you think of something and you drift off for while only to realize that you can find out which part of the song you know about three people who are istjs although ve only met one of them in real life and the other two are online friends the istj that know in real life and have quite good get along well with my intj and intp friends although the intp friend is little more harder to figure out an isfp friend and have disputed little in the past but we got over it rather books yes usually find it difficult to trust people unless it after prolonged period of time that know them most of the time they trust me first so reciprocate it back but this is only remembered last time when we went overseas we stayed at hotel called mayfair garden out of nowhere for the rest of the trip just kept on singing mayfair garden hotel hotel aloud if you were like computer program or robot how would you be programmed to work what is your mentality and outlook on life would be programmed to work very hard when could and then usually get lonely at times when realize that m surrounded by people that don know me well ii don know well or iii are hard to bond with because they are from very different only like shopping for books usually spend more than an hour at bookstore even more if it bigger tongue but books are expensive here hence just look and hope that can borrow it talk to myself quite often as well usually think should do this next or okay let see what can do about this it led to few hilarious times when my mum was really convinced shocked 99 of this is true for me always send my friends long texts because always have so much to say even if their reply is only 1 2 sentences usually m sensitive to coffee at times type infj eye colour dark brown although now it lighter than it used to be with rim of black yes please tongue also

              " ' thank you so much that was super informative too and it really nice to have an outside perspective on this what the actual heck m crying can believe actually liked doctor who that not even funny ve been trying to figure out my type for probably close to year by now used to consider myself an intp but decided that was probably way off after lot of research and asking experts on interesting thank you very much thank you for the confirmation it still helps lot think haven really narrowed it down to just intp or esfj these are just the ones ve considered most first off ve been studying mbti for about year now and always considered myself an welcome from your answers neither have you looked into istp based on your answers that what would think it quite interesting that we have the same taste in instruments ve learned to play piano trombone violin and alto saxophone don really think it has anything to do with an increase in fe multi tasking usually when m excersizing drawing doing something don usually enjoy ll just multi task with something do enjoy for example ll be walking jogging while listening see white and gold sometimes blue and gold though after reading the wired article and seeing the actual dress on amazon say it black and blue even if don see that in the picture any thoughts on mbti cognitive function linking to left brain vs right brain what do you consider most intp to be friend and were talking while back and we noticed that ne fi te si if you consider irresistible as planning out the murder of each and every person in the room then sure this is quite the interesting theory so please don think m dismissing it as whole do like the concept but the only thing that does confuse me is that you re almost saying it impossible m not even an intj but that actually cracked me up maybe it even an nt thing guess just enjoy dark humor an intp who gains confidence in his theories will take on intj characteristics so you re basically saying that in order for an intp to be confident then they have to have intj characteristics my theory on intp emotions is that we have just as many as the other types but we re so afraid of them that we surpress them unhealthy intp don really have filter for their emotions so d say you re definitely an intp just not stereotypical intp mean most people think intp are awkward and procrastinating people but there are just as many healthy intp out there like as it seems you often find ways to manipulate questions into certain results m going to try and make the questions to where it harder for you to do that please try and make your answers as m in like 7th grade so don think need to worry too much about the details right now just wanted some sort of goal to work towards besides only understand about 7 words in that entire ve actually been seriously considering both video game designing and movie writing as careers so it quite interesting that those are some of the examples that you brought up thank you perhaps but what sort of career degree would you be able to get off of that suppose is what m trying to figure out are there any 2 3 types that you have narrowed it down to if so could try providing questionare and typing you off of your answers that not bad idea at all ll have to start doing that usually prepare what m going to say but as m speaking m kind of double checking my speech and making sure that said everything right and if mess up then ll start lingering over the ugh this annoys me to no end ll be thinking as m speaking and ll just kind of stop in the middle of my word for like second and then continue my sentence and feel really self concious ve noticed m bit more outgoing than most intp not quite entp though ve checked and guess d be fine if it were someone geniunly liked d probably want to go to the movies or aha guess deciding on goal is what m trying to do maybe ll enjoy doing physics though wouldn know since my math capabilities are nowhere near that level at the time so ve heard the saying thrown around lot something about how intp are good at lot of things but not really amazing at anything have quite long way to go even go to high school and agree with the first post for the most part our emotions are very straight forward suppose which is part of why we re so afraid of them when was little didn know how to control my emotions so surpressed them probably like lot m 13 at the moment and guess m just the slightly insane smart kid at my school nothing more nothing less really but if you think that you think incorrectly then that thought is incorrect which would mean that you think correctly but if you think that you think incorrectly then that thought is incorrect which would mean that you think correctly it actually took me minute to see what you were getting at there interesting though don think quite understand my process of thinking either though think that whenever think it kind this is why don go into the intj forum mean describe your stream of conciousness whenever you have to think up reply to what someone has said or when you re processing math problem what exactly is going through your mind and how let hope m 13 years old and an intp and all ve learned from reading through this is to stop dressing like serial killer and don chase your dreams thanks guys you rock hate romance movie books anything once went to friend birthday party and they decided to watch the fault in our stars and complained so much that my friend literally broke and she try not to place label on things like good or bad the way see everything simply is the word is is another form of be and the definition of be is to exist so by my previous maybe instead of asking bunch of strangers online you could actually try doing research on the matter 1 you did pretty good don shut down though and stop talking he knows something is wrong and he ll probably overthink it and think that you dislike him now or something or you re too clingy how would you murder someone and what would be the ideal type to have as partner in crime good example of logical would be like okay so had this teacher in middle school and she would always show us the short cut way of doing algebra and what not and remember would always ask usually an enfp or entj just by the way they behave ll usually want to approach one and start conversation but aha of course that never happens so basically just kind of sit there and just being in nature rain thunderstorms looking at stars and also enjoy when something unpredictable happens usually keep pessimistic view on things so whenever things turn out nicely its as an intp what is your learning style if you re unsure d suggest taking an online test or just researching them and choosing the one you think best fits you there are many different names but normally in video games just rush in and slaughter people and sometimes do things stealthily rationally if m in the mood for world of warcraft love playing disc priest cry so damn much like even if just get little stressed out ll just like burst into tears and it really ugly and try and act cool about it but eh ',\n",

with you completely but still curious about other people types figured that might get that answer but if you had to choose one and m not saying that in real life it that kind of choice which would it be how do you see your life turning out do you wish an average life having 9 to 5 job wife and kids etc or do you think life of adventure and uncertainty is better suited for you m not sometimes think most people make their lives seem more interesting than they really are so you get the feeling yours is boring and uneventful but sometimes it pretty damm interesting more so might give hungary go it close and my people have had some experience with that school so it looks promising thank you for the advice dd nah not really just joking around but do tell me more of this dictatorship institute do they have european branch double post first order of buisness double posts are mandatory so what you re saying is that the job competition is high not sure but even with that in mind still think it a more realistic goal than visible abs at least in the whole dictator department the confess that wish had serious goal in life something like complete world domination or visible abs etc you know what mean hahhah see you know us better than you think good example of that would be you explaining to me and convincing me that can pass all of my finals based purely on charm also on more serious note if you re interested no test or anything of the sort one thing ve noticed do always seek is potential possibility of growth and so on m not really interested in well you certainly pass the can you write thread that shoots up my already high ego even higher test so keep up the good work that because we are to boldly go where no man or woman has gone before is entps goal in life or something like that perc2 agree that we can be provocative in arguments but don think that adds to the belief that we re better than everyone it just annoys the hell out of them laughing and makes it easier for us to don

the easier questions really have fever so can really think straight buut remember this scene from big fish where the guy get killed by bear sargemaximus so your passion are movies do you plan on doing something in that direction for your job like hilary swank too saw her movie s love you and normally don really like roadlesstravelled do you have an idea where you want to go in life what interests you have so so many interests and things that are close to my heart that have hard time deciding what would you know to be honest have no idea right now ll have to think about that that sad the only thing can think of right now is the kings speech that movie didn blow me away but it was sargemaximus yes it truly is but it so rare to find nowadays can remember the last time was blown away by movie the animations get better and more impressive every year but the also saw oz the great and powerful with mila kunis michelle williams and james franco it was disappointing from watching the trailer

people are done with college it gets really hard to meet new people and stay in contact with the old ones because everybody is busy working when you are done with your had those thoughts too in not so good moments those thoughts tend to come back but you have to realise that that is not the truth it just matter of time until you meet the right person thank you so much for taking the time to share your thoughts on this with me you are right it hurts really bad to hear all of this probably because it the truth and don want to admit it to no that was before send him the picture but guess yoy are right sad don really know where to begin we know each other for 2 2 1 2 years lived together for one year in place where teenagers can go if it not possible for them to live at home anymore due zadriela can understand lot of your thoughts went through some similar situations you shouldn regret opening up about your feelings for him even though thought the same way when zadriela for how long haven you guy talked isn there some way to get back in contact with him it depends try not to expect anything from people so you can be dissapointed but that isn always working out what is annoying is that daydream lot and imagine how things could turn so was lurking in the infp forum and found thread about this topic and thought it would be awesome to have one here too hope m not getting in trouble for copying tongue just found there stewie from family guy love that kid kitteh way of the sword thank you for your post that was really helpful asked him why he did it he said he was immature wasn ready to be serious and wanted to end contact with me he thought it female infj yes still like him would even say that m still in love with him opened up to him about with something did something that never wanted to do and he messed up about it big so what are you able to forgive and then move on what would you never forgive m in situation where really want to forgive person but m not sure if it the right thing to do because how do you feel you differ from other types in sexual terms and do you have any anxiety about intimacy with new partners don know if am any different compared to other types but m this you want to be happy but it more complicated than that you are both attracted by and suspicious of happiness the concept of it provokes conflicting feelings like everyone else you allow would love to find guy that would be comfortable to cry in front of me m sorrounded by boys and men that always play the nothing can stop me hurt me role and think seeing guy crying in need to talk to somebody and just my cat is home thought about that too the sports bra thing because hate running with sweaty shirt on but m afraid do people give you weird looks or shout inappropriate things wish had the courage synched just love the sound and how everything looks so gloomy would take rain over the sun every day to be honest just weird like that wow thats hard one guess twice my weight then raiiin love rain would you rather drink shot of onion juice or eat two cooked snails would rather live without having to drink food is just too good would you rather want to live in world where it constantly summer or winter anannya24 think your right want to do and start soo many things and then start something and after while get bored get bored so fast with things sometimes then there is another topic can identify myself with that too can spend hours and hours looking at outfits on pinterest or instagram or looking at makeup looks on youtube in the end save up so many pictures of stuff wow never fully realized this but that exactly how am or was in the past not that m proud of it but walked away from lot of people nothing really bad happened with those people like i ve never been on date and how the majority seems to see it it might be the way to go the whole official date thing always made me feel nervous and uncomfortable in my mind so think will m bored right now m watching youtube videos that are quite funny but it still boring could watch tv but think would still be bored even when it fairly interesting don know m bored right now soo bored right now want gummy candy m also reading quiet rather slow because some parts are pretty boring to me but also really like how she explains the difference between being ex or introverted why do you want to do that m asking because also take anti depressants is there difference and everybody keeps telling me that will have to take them forever because with depression how is it do you like it there then just let us

it is oh yeah definitely they have dating profiles diet regimens and career advice all based around what your blood type is there an entire subculture built around blood typing it super huge potentially it really depends on the person the door slam is subjective reaction so what will trigger it precisely is going to vary bit if had to hazard guess it possible she so was curious if anyone tried to type the characters from the metal gear solid rising etc series before given the complexity of the series themes and the number of characters it features greetings enfp and welcome to the forum m an infj glad to have more intuitive feelers around though all kinds are welcome damn that a difficult situation you re in and assuming you re being honest which by default do assume with posts like these pretty baffling but ll make try of it it sounds like what definitely when someone care about is really happy or enthralled about something feel happy too mean isn that what being proud of someone is you feel good for them not just about so m not sure what the protocol is for revisiting subjects that were discussed earlier whether it better to resurrect an old thread or start new one saw few people do the latter though while it certainly true that different countries have cultural predispositions that affect the mannerisms and behavior of their people d hesitate to classify any country as one personality type ll admit m bit surprised at that daenerys hate from what understand she usually typed as an infj and that besides she got pretty fervent fandom in both the books and the television these days mostly avoid making resolutions because it seems as though there an unspoken consensus that you don have to keep them so what the point really instead just hope for good allow me to join the manifold chorus of welcome and happy new year glad to see another intj around m an infj myself but know quite few intjs and get along with them relatively well greetings intp m an infj supposedly that means we should get along but then find most people agreeable happy hey fellow spheniscid and welcome to the forum hope you enjoy your stay happy this place seems pretty friendly to me so think you ll do fine speaking from personal experience would gladly take both but feel more warmth when do something for someone else that heartily appreciated than when that someone does something for me it believe you can don believe it typical for people to change completely but there a fair amount of evidence in the field of psychology that people can change lot over several years i sorry you re in such bad spot ll try to help however can can relate to this wasn exactly straight student in high school but was definitely singled out as it used to be really hard to get me to cry during movie or tv show now tear up really easily especially when already know what going to happen this applies for both happy tears and sad ha that so typically me my favorite kind of games tend to be rpgs but enjoy large swath of genres and really enjoyed rts games like age of empires ii the age of kings or homeworld as i think it very interesting that you ve typed yourself as an infp even though you test as an infj m not saying you re wrong it just that from what ve heard it far more common for people m in my mid 20s so theoretically m finishing development on my ti and beginning to develop my se but here the thing don think mbti types fit to particular set of cognitive functions as it a bit hard to explain wasn in love with her when met with her or very soon afterward we were just friends though good friends at that she was also married at the time though she i admit that may be an issue her boyfriend and have had pretty civil interactions up to this point but telling her and the fact that m offering her permission to tell him may indeed disrupt allow me to offer warm welcome to you stupidgenious think my youngest brother one and we get along fantastically so it great to see another around hope you enjoy your time here ve it possible she fairly perceptive and ve been so emotionally expressive in our relationship that can help but wonder if she knows sometimes but close friend of hers suspected already she already knows m very fond of our friendship so suppose what want her to know is that m interested in her romantically but also don want to give her the feeling that m coming onto sorry for the long response time ll try to get back to each of you as quickly as can fair enough can really ask anymore than that have not been in her position or yours alright so ve been meaning to ask this for awhile but ve put it off because wanted to get to know the community little better before making go at it fortunately the forums has turned out think that a pretty outmoded deterministic view of both sexes that research and my own experience shows isn nearly as accurate as you portray it to be okay ll take shot yes you re probably moving little fast since you ve only known each other for short time but it sounds like she likes you lot and she enjoys talking with you so fair enough for what it worth don think idealism is foolish or that we should shy away from calling ourselves idealists d rather be romantic who sometimes disappointed in life oh you misunderstand me m not saying you should ever tolerate serious problems in relationship if they get in the way of either you or your partner enjoyment of one another and life openness is probably the best route think it hard and it puts you in position of vulnerability but it better to make your expectations clear than hope they figure it out themselves agree with this though don think d put it quite so harshly think dating works for lot of people and won begrudge someone if they want to start out that way in relationship but wow that painfully accurate frustrating don like to admit it because feel it unfair to my friends but really do get anxious when contact isn regular but at the same time don oh definitely speaking as someone who suffers from both as well nothing goes together quite like fe and depression frustrating if that the case have no doubt that he mostly worried it hard to say like said m not very experienced here the thing infjs fall in love very hard and very fast if he an infj as you say and trust your judgment he probably already m not very experienced in this territory but ll try to help however can one thing you should know about introverts of every stripe is that we re not very comfortable initiating social hmm an interesting question m still not used to trying to type people other than myself but ll give it shot to start with think both of my parents are sort of ambiverts my father actually upon consideration that does make more sense than the other way around m not sure what you mean do you mean that you talk to yourself within your own head hashing out ideas and questioning yourself and such like can relate to that my mind never quiet per se tend to think of shame as being something that inwardly directed where you feel bad towards yourself for failing to meet your own expectations whereas guilt is more about acknowledging the jesus is unusually hard to type because we have so few sources on him and his characterization within the gospels is somewhat inconsistent disclaimer m religiously minded but don adhere to ll have to agree with those who already said rejection one of my greatest fears is failing to live up to the standards of others or the ones which have set for myself worry far more than i personally kind of skeptical about the mbti utility in career advisement even though that one area where it used lot don get me wrong think it really can tell you lot about your they re basically metric of how well any particular component of your mbti score fits you the fact that they run from 1 100 is little bit artificial and may give the wrong impression that one it kind of cliche but often take shower and try to lose myself the hot water helps to cool me down when m feeling really stressed beyond that ll often try to distract myself by finding am thankful for the close friends have and family that cares m thankful for the talents have m thankful for the second chances ve been given and m thankful for having place to welcome fellow maybe infj m not exactly sure why but ve heard that intps and infjs are pretty similar and sometimes mistaken for one another to an extent comparable with infps and intjs hmm interesting m also an infj who been diagnosed with asperger so can relate to lot of what you re saying think lot of people confuse the fact that people with asperger have ',\n",

to analysis paralysis it could be said that am deep thinker prefering to contemplate subjects too fireman policeman astronaut and pirate yeah definitely seriously if could do anything d be independently wealthy so could contribute to society in whatever way fancy at the moment been there done that only it was lake havasu and was miserable actually stayed in and watched tv which made it bearable wear mostly shorts and shirts though would like to dress more fashionably just can seem to do it understand particle physics but fashion eludes me true they indicate anxiety which is raised

interrogations course that helped lot but lot of crooks are great liars its what they do for living as cop think can answer that am good at solving problems and connecting dots can make associations

off beat or unusual sense of humor we sometimes make jokes based upon references to obscure information like 17th century literature and nobody but rabbits lay eggs e the easter bunny thank sometimes forget that was ranting guess was sorry bout that though don agree with drug use if you weren hurting anybody or stealing anything nobody really cares you handled the situation if very mature way but if the cop wasn a rookie he that one actually might work sorry to say but we ve heard all of these before you might be suprised but cops are some of the funniest people know was poli sci major wish had chosen something more practical agree with business or intl relations letters from iwo jima good movie don think anyone is too thrilled to see me naked anyway so don really mind them can see how

told me don open relationships differ from one another or is don ask don tell the norm we are seeing each other non exclusively and going slowly the idea was that if understand correctly you re basically saying he overestimated his interest in me now that the relationship is progressing he is realizing m not really who he wants is that what you re thanks for the feedback and the rainn link may not have been clear in my original post but we are not monogamous we discussed this from the beginning and that why he told me about the thank you for the feedback that more or less what suspected he pretty adamant and open about wanting help so haven been too worried about him being able to deal with his issues am need advice from enfps please m 32 year old female entp dating 27 year old male enfp we met two years ago and had one night stand it was one of those chance encounters we were love talking to ns and nfs especially how do you talk to an sf or an st hmmm wish people in life wore their type around their neck like dog collar thanks for your answer very insightful can you say more about this example with your two current relationships it sounds like you are waiting for some time to pass before you can be certain this is incredibly helpful and rings true really think people can overemphasize personality type some people are immature not ready or just douche wads you can have all the mind blowing like your plan what about infp ve dated infj enfp intp all with varying degrees of success there things liked could do without for each type hence the poll next up have to meet some tjs and try them on for artofbreaking ha so you are fan of ins generally do you like ens too m not going to list my likes because think we are all more or less describing the same man instead evolving this thread to its next logical step ok we all like the same type of guy how this infjs are my favorite people in the world to talk to but don think can be in relationship with one everyone on this website seems to be convinced it the best pairing am doing it ok have some questions for you 1 how do you feel about entp women 2 what is the difference between women you casually sleep with versus women you pursue serious relationships with 3 cloud rattles that makes perfect sense to me any thoughts on her type she must be an fj right she can be super talkative and social but is also homebody she not into exercise or physical cloud rattles of course we apologize when we really mess up but we don give insincere apologies to smooth things over for someone who is irrational hence the factual objective statement this think there some truth to this when was in my mid 20s really became bit more withdrawn and less outspoken was still very social and spontaneous but would be alone lot and know exactly how feel don know never thought about that before m very sorry that my factual objective statement hurt your feelings know why you randomly burst into m sorry to hear it not working out know that must be incredibly disappointing but m happy you know yourself well enough to know when to step away big hug wish was man or at least bisexual then could use this line bestdiss ok it definitely the britney spears pic he probably turned off by the britney spears picture kid kid all the stuff you re describing sounds normal for entps spontaneous suggesting activities hanging out with groups which infj thread checked out few and you guys were kind of assholes question for entps do you ever get the impression that the same pattern repeats on this tread youngish females come on this thread sounding very serious and desperate for help expecting us hate to say it but he has point when guy says can see you being the wife and mother of my kids but m going to keep fucking other people and you can feel free to do the same cus ya lmao that is the best reply ve ever read on this site state of constant anxiety and sexual frustration accurate description of 90 of people who look to the internet for love advice feel like you are describing gender disconnect more than you are describing mbti m very likely to ignore car issues and rely on men to point these things out to me for all my emotional when said young meant mid twenties you didn sounds like highschooler appreciate your emotional maturity because of life circumstance and personality type infjs tend to be emotionally going back to drmiller100 question it hard to follow what you are asking your original post doesn make sense to me it not clear who is doing saying which parts because there a lack of definitely test the other person in the beginning like to push buttons and figure out how far can go don all women do this to some extent maybe not don play head games once m all agree with all of this with the caveat that guy know can compliment me as in saying you look nice tonight think regardless of type women want men to notice the effort they put in to be clear always think direct open communication is best but she says she has had multiple conversations about this with him that generally he tries and is moving things along at reasonable it already been asked but how old are you m guessing you are in your 20s drmiller100 guessed the same age probably because your situation sounds like something that is not uncommon with it never ceases to amaze me how much people seek to attribute to personality type ve been by numerous people death beds and taken care of my family since an early age but things like gender lucky entp gal super sexy infj who knows how to ignore terrible advice from entp men is headed her way m usually super mia in this early phase of courtship and guys who don persist and this br where are you getting this nbsp can explain exactly why we re convinced marriage is prison br the part of me m scared would die is part of me that is core to my sense of self work for political organization as combination lawyer strategist counsel started out in college being very active in organizing students on campus for various student issues and wow thank you so much for the thorough explanation m trying to take it all in can you explain in more detail the difference between fe and si maybe should clarify remember being 19 and realizing had feelings but didn know how to tap in to them address them or connect to them until about 28 should have clarified that my comments were in regards to emotional maturity had steady career at 21 and have been developing it successfully for the last ten years no problem in the job this reminded me of you good luck with everything age 2 memorize all my story books so could fake out the adults and pretend read by turning the page at the right time age 6 carry on adult conversations age 9 sound remarkably smarter than ok now that you two are done stroking each other allow me to interject with female opinion so much of mbti is moot in the face of gender differences anyhow here are some questions that can you explain all this m not so fluent in the lingo but have been changing lot over the last few years my emotional maturity seems to be kicking in and m eager to sort it and understand do infjs worry lot it seems like they put lot of thought in to things and analyze the crap out of stuff never notice but then they give off such an air of bravado that it always surprises me fascinating because nk and were just discussing this in another thread we decided the combo has to be entp guy and infj gal why do you think this gender combo works better what do you mean my first love was quite young was 17 he was 19 it was like something out of movie was convinced that no two people had ever felt this way before and thought we would always be together ',\n",

of hey person you ve inspired me in ways that you ll never realize ve been putting many other things on hold this past year just to focus on areas of my life which feel are in need of work dear person was actually thinking about ditching social function tonight then you suddenly popped into the scene seemingly out of nowhere yeah took lot in me to act cool and push aside dear infp m only saying this here and never to you in real life yes m coward but m sorry if came off slightly abrasive and dismissive earlier today only realized about 20 think may have finally found someone within my group whom can consider my equal and possibly ally m going to hang out with him for bit and gauge things dear person struggled with and grappled with my obsession with you for nearly year am now thanking god almighty that it finally vanishing without any sort of strong bond between us mood the swings suck reinventing myself is proving to be more frustrating and difficult than hoped it be like any other goal it sounds great and motivational when you spell out what you dear person there is nothing more to sbl than meets the eye so stop treating me like some kind of mystery that needs revealing while it true that keep secrets it really no different from rant of the day looks like it going to be fairly quiet week might be an opportunity for me to spend my after hours reflecting on my current goals and plans and making any adjustments haven dear friends all good things must come to an end the sun is setting on my stay with this group as look to what lies in the future feel yearning once again for adventure any plans to dear old friend it pains me to say this but unfortunately will be ducking out of your upcoming birthday party with fake excuse m sorry really am but as working guy just don have you ever had feeling that life was sort of just passing you by with very little you could do about it because that what m feeling today like have little control over anything and that mood bit anxious hanging out with large groups of people many whom ve never met before has never been an easy affair but it something d best get used to if it not friends family and the world telling me need to stop being coward it my own subconscious mind reminding me of the lessons of the past brief trip down memory lane tonight within this past week alone everything from my meetings with really successful people about my age and even random incidents upon hindsight have been reminding me need to move on and choose path come again dear persons you know who you are you guys need to stop elevating me as some kind of divine cool guy figure it true ve done things that have helped the group out but the focus really needs if there one cold hard truth ve had to accept it that can expect to be able to connect with and befriend every single person identify as being cool and friendly it sucks but it dear person this is the second time we ve run into each other at our group socials and must say m not disappointed to say in the least even though we ve spoken with each other just couple short term fad but still find it quite fun in my experiences it been less about the game and more about just running into people and sharing in the joy of exploring while catching pokemon rant of the day can wait for the weekend this week is really testing my patience for plethora of reasons ve accepted can control the chaos that comes about but it be nice having dear person think you ve gotten me wrong another person in our community has suggested that you think have some kind of strange crush on you yeah no you re wrong and if you re going to dear person thank god you weren there at today get together man how things have changed between us when we started running into each other you were that girl always looked forward to rant of the day m having mixed feelings about this circle of friends ve been with for few years thought for while maybe was going through funk or that was just out of touch but vent of the day have to remind myself that the good days are often easy come easy go there are times when feel m really in the zone m tackling every challenge in front of me and my quality of life has improved over the past couple of months do martial arts and hang out once in while with this group that meets up once in while for random fun in my area and ve been rant of the day thought that certain acquaintence could become good friend he and started off on really friendly terms even fit into one of my groups very well early on but lately so there a devil even in infp angels shocked feel you there even this istj has regretted showing his more cold calculating side absolutely nothing upright and morally driven about it nah just typical drama you ve an infp being crushed on and then an influential figure within our circle who creating trouble for the group and then there me reluctant rebel come to dear infp the cards are all falling into place have gathered contingent of loyal followers who re ready to break off from our group and form separate faction our own have already had funny moment today while walking to the restrooms door knob got caught on my shirt and created an inch long tear after brief moment of assessing the damage and feeling frustrated dear infp m glad to see you re settled into our group and that you ve become core member that was something was hoping for when you first joined but alas it does sadden me to know that been going to this weekly meditation group for few weeks now using this as an opportunity to grapple with couple of personal issues that have lingered around for years think can say it we get bad rap for being rigid but in this case it about principles and being very cautious ve decided can never be too careful and this dang feeler in this case is suspected infp we re out there and we re quite common we just prefer being outside the limelight you infps are known to be even more reclusive than us so it would actually require you to not only step out of dear intj you say people are questioning my intentions understand you said this out in the open as half joke but knowing you it was also an accidental cue to me that small clique in 2 things need to get off my damn chest dear estj haven been completely honest about my past and m thankful you haven used your authority to look more closely into my file imagine it a tough journey reassembling the pieces of the thing that is my life redefining who want to become and finding satisfaction with what have right now keep telling myself that am the dear infp m relieved to finally be seeing my feelings for you go away m not feeling nearly as much of the pent up resentment from not having what desire or the occasional moment of not too far off the mark ve come to accept that you lot tend to have very creative minds certainly does make for some interesting discussion topics strength of fellow introvert op you need to give us more this is relatively less known forum so you can probably give us more details and leave out names without the fear of having someone irl discover this thread the dear infp damn it took me while but finally got over my incessant crush for you you ll probably never realize the extreme measures took to make it happen made an extra effort to go out hardly anything beautiful in someone else emotional pain and yes had to get it off my chest what hurts bit is when she still seems bit curious about me even with all these other guys dear infp if it looks like m somewhat distancing myself from possibly even doing subtle things to avoid you you re not wrong in your guess because that exactly what happening before did it found my conscience screaming out at me when my group leader tried to get me to enforce very very bad rule on the group told my leader couldn in good conscience do it and asked the realist says you don you throw yourself into other activities and stay busy you focus on getting to know more people along the way and discovering there a bigger world beyond that one m fine most days it seems like as long as m keeping busy m fine and dandy but there are just some days where the weightiness of my situation feels like it too much to bear it a mixture yep like an angel or angelic is how ve seen people here and on other forum boards describe infps don consider that bad thing by any stretch of imagination if anything that makes you rant of the day after months of weighing the pros and cons and thinking things over carefully ve finally decided to leave the group for good and on good terms no drama involved just rising op what you are saying sounds exactly like how m feeling about another community m part of and am making plans to leave it at some point probably best to leave out the

you guys you guys are all really thoughtful and have to say even if need more time to think of the best symbolic way for me to do this being able to have discussion about maybe better angle to go at it would be to the idea of the misunderstandings between us or the fact there are things that will never be made meaningful or explainable to me so then was obviously can do anything as cheesy as broken heart looked up to see if there was flower that meant anything like good intentions or bitterness or broken heart or something about the agree with orangeappled in what love about make up and with sittapygmaea in what hate about make up picking my outfit make up that goes with the outfit and having my morning coffee are instrumentals they say things words cant feeling empathy and learning how to express it constructively are different parts of the brain it is true that not all types are naturally empathetic at least not all the time in my experience she sounds manipulative she breaks up with you for attention and re paints her motivation as benign to get attention she made your dad death all about her by instigating drama am sure you do lol don think we do have reputation as high matinence am high matienence in that require love sex affection reassurance and someone to listen to me and deal with my emotions if m that depends kitteh ask for advice refuse it wake up when sleeping tell long stories with no point pertaining to nothing relevant to them continue changing the answers so you can never master the system for from my intp boyfriend you would be in be in prison and there would be parole board to get out the parole board would consist of me and the owner and operator of hell an omnipotent irreplaceable don think that possible like think that wall is thicker than you think wait have you done that my apologies sir how dare peeve you ve had passionate steamy grand gesture romance and it can end very brutally they may not be able to weather the downs because that kind of love can thrive on idealized visions and romance and what are you guys like in healthy relationships what do you like how do you express love those complaining about how such things do not exist for intps or generally bemoaning singlehood maybe you could ask him directly if he wants to make out and then run and hide if it excruciatingly awkward and never see him again she wasn asking if he be jealous she was saying since she isn committed to him and she does not have to ask permission if she chose to sleep with someone else should she stop having sex with also don ues the fact this person as an intp to excuse anything that seems manipulative or using as logic infp behavior or sometihng someone can be emotionally detached without being everything would seem normal but the wear the pants in this relatonship is blatant power play fwbs and sexual but not exlcusive and friendly romantic relatiosnhps can exist but that still has did it end up ok edit that was posted in caps but they edited the caps away let me try again did it end up ok ficsci got really emotionally involved in your story my heart was so tense as was reading and admire how you took the plunge please give me details or they delete thread that getting long because it taking up phone memory but not the thread with their boyfriend because it has happy memories works in tech support it completely normal ok she may or may not but to help you re thinking disregard anything that happened before you were official before she knew if you two were exclusive she cannot be construed as being that common sense to me d agree but think you ultimately want the peopel close to you to find something special about you as find in them feel uncomfortable asking this but because m worried for you inquire where do you live and if its in the usa are you black native american or hispanic make it habit by doing it often but working it into way that rewards me play music or tv show like in the background and let myself organize and decorate as go split into rooms as tb this looks kind of odd in that if he views you as friend or has potential attraction to you but isn actively pursuing you isn the kind to do so and has other stuff going on in his life same at my current job my boss is pushibg me to build rapport with every customer and wouldn believe that was even possible except for some people work with genuinely do just that or just don know you seem to have grasp of different areas of your personality m not sure quite what to tell you can somewhat relate to lots of what you say how do you like being haha yep that was it really feel like have something to tell you but m not sure how ok for example sometimes at my jobs something will end up bothering me be it situation that feels like there idk think flirt lot whether it percieved as such by others or m good at m not sure shrug don thinking that way is really the point of it for those who don know omegle com is anonymous chat routlette don wear for those with social anxiety you don have to show your face and can easily disconnect and it anonymous you can hahaha sometimes m good with kids but sometimes m not went out with my co worker and her kid think is kind of shy and awkward and wanted me to be silly and kidlike with her like chase her it just on the internet other types like to use this to idk feel stronger or tougher or smarter or something in reality think most infps are slightly detached and analytical they may be kind think people are being insensitive by making big thing of something that generally makes the people feel better involved swept under the rug and the fact they re in high school and fascinated by nothing to do with type would prefer my so would be less comfortable sharing his bodily functions with me he farted on me while spooning last night said dude really and rolled spend more time itneracting with women and try to view the world more objectively to idealize someone is to dehumanize them keep working on it until you understand why that is you guys can tell m joking and it making me unsure if should explain was joking or just continue in the same vein so ll just take moment to say this is just me bored pouting m not he did not spend tonight with me stupid boy he is no longer fuzzy now he is an urchin insensitive sea urchin get where you re coming from think the thoughts are rational but the emotions are very very strong think when you re in better spot and more calm they ll simmer down into smaller tbh m not super into the story on gow just play the fight only themes like vs horde because like the shooter part the story parts just seem to annoy me that very generous of you sends crossword puzzle lol who said you guys can charm any woman online

              " 'that what m leaning towards to as well at first left door open for ni dom as well because there was and still is too little content to not keep the horizon of possibilities wider but he about wanna one woojin introvert fe usage seems much more likely than fi te jihoon get ip vibes from him but have no particular reasons to defend those types over any other probable what post was it if you remember and don mind sharing it of course used to peg him as an istp and by used to mean in february march 2015 then his mixtape came out and realized how it is indeed very curious maybe because of xxxp stereotypes and the fact that it typed by letters idols wouldn have achieved what they have achieved without being hardworking very ambitious ll be honest disagree with literally all of these whoops agree with hope and taehyung too but m very much certain that namjoon is an infj and he probably the one person in the industry whose personality ve studied the most along with louis an estp are there any specific reasons that lead you to this typing we basically agree on every other typing we do differ on which xsfp niall is but it a small difference compared to not to act like m beyond all drama but how about we put an end to this discussion it obvious everyone involved has grab too tight on their own view of the situation to ever reach middle about kibum may review the content that lead to my entj typing and see if still agree or not considering that estp typing because typed shinee over the summer and haven really watched any would say naeun from apink is very likely intj way over those who went for inxp which really can see other than that can think of any other female idols male intjs woozi from jeez these type of things really give me headache they did it last year too and tiffany got entj which anyone who knows at least 20 of both tiffany and mbti would find laughable every single well this thread is dead let see if can make it come to life again does anyone have any guesses on gfriend types know someone already asked once but nobody said anything so m bringing m gonna assume you ve been watching weightlifting fairy tried typing him this summer from what read and watched definitely saw fi and he an introvert for sure didn really peg about the typings that are currently being talked about got7 definitely disagree with the typings they were given in hard carry m very confident in most of my typings so ll share them and m surprised twice has never been brought up here before at least nothing shows up when search up the group so if anyone has any thoughts on them they like to share m curious as to what watched something recently that made me completely see dom fe for jeonghan rather than aux fe so m totally behind esfj now quick question about these two as an istp and having seen update on my typings joshua is definitely fe aux recently got into them and binge watched some of their stuff and these are my guesses sunggyu high te user most likely istj he was typed as an istp in test he did but 1 tests are rewatched gmw recently and m watching the new episodes and don know why but m starting to see both so much ni and fe in farkle could easily include istp and infj as options now who was have to bring up seventeen again they haven been discussed enough still have lot of trouble figuring out some of their types the lack of insightful interviews is killing me would anyone stella being an isfj makes lot of sense so support it zoey is probably an xxfp don remember enough about the show but the fi is very obvious maybe leaning towards xnfp over anything well it doesn exist so guess someone had to create it riley enfj have soooooo much to say about this so if anyone disagrees or wants me to explain ll gladly do so maya xsfp this thread has been dead for 4 years but totally agree with xsfp for justin leaning towards isfp however still would consider entj for brian one with unhealthy se barney stinson is another m aware ptsd can affect all types m just pretty sure from experience which think for mbti it counts more than untested theory found online that it tends to affect si types more however m sure trauma was part of it the thing is when everything else in the movie signs towards him being an entp the past affecting him to that extent only makes the typing even clearer and further there a pretty fair enough amount of maura in blue lily lily blue though so if you get there and have any new theories or anything it would be great to hear your opinion on it so far also i agree with everything blue being an infp except calla who feel is more of an enfp but feel free to fight me about this don have incredibly strong feelings on this typing and maura why nick is not an estp he an entp believe me when say that most se users know be it strong ones or weak ones find it extremely hard to hold grudge or be defined by their past in any way yeah that exactly what got me thinking about ne ti over ni te he very good at considering many possibilities then discarding some by using past experience the data he has learnt logic what m an istp and house is an entp and never claimed otherwise at least not intentionally maybe my wording jinxed the meaning of the sentence accidentally but never defended inferior fe for well first of there a big enough gap between tertiary fe and inferior fe secondly if really wish to understand others can assure you ll put all the interest have in other to figure do ti fe users not seek to understand others better in an almost clumsy way because the reason why love mbti so much is because it a helpful tool for me to understand others better as m not totally agree with anyone who argued entp for house definitely see ti in him he thrives on curiosity and need to fix problems beyond just the facts he loves pondering about the possible issues this thread is dead but m here with problematic opinions probably gordie infp even though infj is my second safest bet he relies so much on other people opinions so at first saw that as could totally see it since didn particularly have preference for her being an infp except me getting certain vibes from her which is shitty typing any of those two types would make sense to m just gonna add my 2 cents in here sun istj kala isfj think saw ni for second there but honestly she way too traditional and permissive nomi infp know everyone keeps m gonna go ahead and say that really agree with your book typings and my show typings which are not determined are pretty similar to yours agree that clary se feels stronger in the tv agree basically with all of this mean particularly would type gansey as an enfj because his mental speech is constant of how is everyone else doing and if something is wrong in their m gonna copy and paste here what wrote on my blog about anakin type personally type anakin as an isfp 8w7 considering the writing ix92m not entirely opposed to esfp mean if you see m very shocked at everyone here typing shadowhunters alec as an intj or even infj see so much si in him literally laugh whenever he opens his mouth his motto is the law is hard but it maybe you re referring to her time magazine interview source but itx92s the same thing as living your life based on what your grandkids will say one day ix92m sure there will be things that my collecting celebrity friends don know either she has very good pr team or she very social doesn seem particularly se to me since many celebrities have large group of celebrity as big fan of her that has watched and read almost every single interview she has ever given to the public and as someone who is weak fe user can assure you fe is certainly her main did see lily as an xnfp in the beginning but the more watched the more that fi saw during the beginning of the show was translated into fe so maybe it is her character development through the this post is slightly dead but m just going to leave my typings here ted isfj but ix92d accept infj the thing with tedx92s character is that as you watch him in the show you realize that m the first one who is adamant to rey being an istp because as one didn relate to her in different levels but wouldn have sold the droid either and would have been as collected as she to everyone who types finn as an exfj can you elaborate was fixated on esfp but did see fe while watching the movie and m going to rewatch it this weekend so your arguments could be useful may be way off but am the only one who saw si in rey she seemed extremely fixated to her past when it came to her family coming back and the moment she was presented with the opportunity to woah hold up there with the clarke typing where are you getting this typing from m an istp and highly dislike her character because of her si fe at many points she definitely doesn have as cliche as it might sound she the first female istp portrayal which don find boring flat and unrealistic she isn just blunt

m dating is also an entj our conversations are very interesting we can argument for ages and discuss topic for ages and it never gets boring the thing love about our conversations is ι attended university for semester in another eu country via the erasmus mobility program ι don usually get angry but when do well let just say no one ever wants me to get mad at them three years ago didn get into the university department wanted instead got into university department that was located faraway from my hometown and from the city all my friends studied in yes m an undergrad student finishing my junior year want to pursue an academic career and in ten years see myself being university lecturer depends most of the times fall from the blonde ale most of the time start writing because have something to write about something want to analyze something want to think through anything that the process go through start with write most of the time start writing because have something to write about something want to analyze something want to think through anything it helps me relax organize my thoughts personal questions about my emotions useless information about other people emotion useless details of why other people crush left them betrayed them whatever useless information in general excuse me if you are to misconceive my words you may as well remain silent honourable delegate to model parliament we had to use formal language the fellow delegate face was really τhank you so much but live in greece we have completely different educational system here you just enter university department and that all no majors no minors no chance of taking always thought wanted to become an attorney however being an undergrad student in classics have found that am really interested in academic research and why not in pursuing an academic fight club dead poets society lion king american history star wars m an entj during high school was very popular had many friends was fashion obsessed was engaged in many activities ran for student body wrote for the school paper etc was maintening everyone gets that feeling now and then but depending on other people views to believe in yourself doesn really work out most people out there care only for themselves because that life and m still an undergrad student but think will pursue an academic career 1 how did you find your first job part or full time online from someone you know walking by sign in front of the place from someone knew and it was part time 2 did having no work just let them be and if they annoy me alot just use emotional words instead of logical arguments and they always end up believing m right these days m in love with so central rain and u200bdrive well said nameuser ll second that letting mbti limiting your job search is useless from where stand there are so many opportunities out there so many things you may enjoy doing so go out wish could take international law political history in the 20th century and many more courses but can greek educational system all my life was planning on getting into law school and become either an attorney or politician however life changes m currently at my junior year at university studying classics and writing reading studying various subjects politics youth leadership programs and seminars music anything that has to do with classics learning foreign languages and m member in an book that has collection of che guevara political speeches don get easily angry in debate as long as the other person treats me the way treat him her remain calm and always listen to the other person statements before express mine when if had to choose now d choose friends with benefits why because don care for deep romantic relationship at the moment am focused on finishing my studies and getting into law school depends on the relationship when end it never look back never miss the other person never feel the need to contact him again but once the other person ended it and was quite the phantom of the opera had the chance to watch it live last christmas in london and was totally blown away by the production it was wonderful irony but still don see where you re heading at actually don see the point of raises brows at entjs uhm well don see the point of this thread entj would become diplomat politician lawyer or university professor d work hard and be on the top of my domain d be part time writer d write about political philosophy d list same here but there was nothing about the blue sky that would indicate that someone was to die that certain day and the soldiers on the street and the yelling of the crowd and the blood on the street it all ι used to be child actress it was really interesting hobby but gave it up for the shake of foreign languages still can act think τhank you didn know there was an older similar topic we did when speaked managed to destroy all the positions of the other speakers proving them that they were just misrepresenting all of my team arguments just to get their way anyway d agree with you but in model parliament you listen to some arguments for the first time it inevitable you can rely on prior planning alone when one speaker has one minute to speak and you first learned that was an entj when visited psychotherapist to have an iq test at the age of 16 she also gave me personality test to solve and ta da the result was entj of course after so participated in model parliament last week as member of parliament and of course noticed all the speakers also noticed that was better off organizing people and taking charge of in terms of diplomacy when you re strategic you can still be honest but maybe you can make situation look little bit better that it actually is that what mean by the term strategic of need honesty and freedom in relationship no drama no extreme emotional situations want it to be joyful adventurous interesting and emotionally equal don want to have the role of

              " 'i guess ollivander is an istj based on the first post you re definitely an ixtj probably intj think he more like an isfj for example how he says there no reason for him to distrust snape since dumbledore trusts snape don think m necessarily repulsed by fe but think it is usually better to use te want to be sure of my mbti and it has recently become bit more difficult does anyone know what an isfj who uses more ti than fe really looks like compared to an istj you seem more than but m not able to be completely sure based on this try filling out questionnaire it helps why not try checking which function you re most definitely not dominant with and then look at the opposite of that function actually it looking like the majority is wrong while m right on this definitely see se above si in your answer to question 9 not all isfps are the same some are forceful others are laid strange that no one has said isfp in this thread yet that what think you are m not sure can see snape being inferior with te yet he is stronger with te than with fi he is relying on external rules and laws anyone who just watches the films and doesn read the books won know that sirius and lupin used to be in the shrieking shack while it shown that they treated snape badly snape still could have that was not in the film think you could be an istj what do you think about this type do its functions fit you if you really want to know which type you are study and learn the functions severus snape in the harry potter films is an intj because he suspecting quirrell to be on the bad side based on nothing except for his ni he also the only teacher to come to the shrieking agree with you about all this except for about snape what made you say infp above istj for him in general this isn indicative of him using fi ne above si fe where do you see his fi that part about him being good at reading his students would be fe lupin has also had many experiences of the map never lying the rest is behaviour an isfj could also have another thing the m pretty sure he has to be either an isfj or an infj these two types can be difficult to tell apart my view of lupin however is that he dominant with si rather than with ni he could really snape had more friends other than lily while at school does anyone here think snape could be dominant with te and be either an estj or an entj it was random thought that crossed my mind and m bit surprised about the fact that absolutely nobody would disagree with few of the op typings both hermione and snape appear to be sjs m having hermione as an estj and snape as an istj got isfj or infj m not sure if see ni or si as the dominant function but that fe focus on others is there think you re introverted because of your answer to question 9b based on this she definitely an introvert but that all can be sure of try filling out stickied questionnaire and see what people get from that get enxp from that you can actually be an istp and use more ni than se consider istp as well snape actually has fi over fe if saw some intuition in snape such as him considering harry might have to die before dumbledore told him then would say he is an intj but now don see m dominant with si and don either think you should think too much about sad memories it better to think about happy memories true but based on his behaviour istj is still my best guess but don sjs think about the past more than others si compares what the senses currently say to what they have said before you need that it see tertiary fi now now think snape actually is an istj it is bad that more than half of everyone who voted thinks snape is an intj intjs think more about the future than the past snape does the opposite of that he can be an istj but he can be an see tefi here not feti you say that you re ruled by your strong emotions in stressful situations which would be tertiary fi rather than auxiliary fe so my guess is that you are an intj an intp can also be sentimental about one of the people he cares most about that not necessarily fi by definition there was scene where think snape behaviour fitted carl jung he didn only do that he gave harry other things as well in short period of time snape can be really good at adapting such as when he dies esfp seems possible has nobody got anything to say actually have changed my opinion from intp to istj m 18 years old and am currently attending school which began at at the age of 16 and will quit at the age of 20 it is currently the summer holidays in mbti mostly relate to si then te by reading this am reminded about the descriptions for ti and don think your ti is weaker than your fe at all m going to guess intp for you for example your answers to questions 10 and 12 agree with lot if not all of this please people keep discussing snape mbti he a well written character thanks in advance an esfp is better with se than fi an isfp is better with fi than se an esfp is better with te than ni an isfp is better with ni than te esfps focus more on the outer world isfps focus more on you might be an xsfp if you want to know your type for sure though learn the functions ll help you doing that bit if you want to whatever you are you re not dominant with fe so that means not enfj where do you see ni and te in snape think hagrid was more of an than an esfp luna was ti user intp fred and george were using lot of ne enxps d say ixfp seems like good fit for you going on the information provided in this thread you appear to be introverted and an fi user ',\n",

it my hair has gone from full after many years of having many different roomies can safely say the only really personality requirement is that they are another introvert extroverted roomies can be annoying as hell just double post one thing ve noticed lately that haven before is how important the height of the guy is to girls like seriously it almost the one universal so how tall is tall m 6ft which is bog absolutely this as result have to cut them more regularly to stop them becoming too long and looking like howard hughes nails that are too short are worse than torture while it hard to read context without seeing body language it sounds like perhaps he doesn have many platonic female friends and so is was confused about you intentions if he agrees to meet up but seriously grace

stop putting expectations on how open you should be at this stage of the relationship just enjoy and support one another and the openness will come as infjs we tend to express our true selves doing the 8values test got social libertarian believe in free education and free health care though m not anti capitalism don really care how other people live their lives provided thanks for replying after taking few days to cool off ve decided that the next time see her will try one more sincere apology and let her know just what the friendship means to me and see get this lot with colleagues as you say it feels good the first time but certain people will tell you the same exact story over and over usually after ve heard the same story 4 times i usually try and prepare but just ended up sort of winging it anyway might use some brief notes if need to raise several points but find it just seems more natural when wing it my gf hates the bubble when m in it she usually has to call out my name several times before snap back to reality feel there is definitely certain romance to the idea of keeping journal don keep one in the traditional sense but do post in another online forum where have over 18 000 posts on almost find my energy levels are mainly affected by motivation inspiration if m motivated to do something can run on fumes if not would be quite happy to sleep all day as marv mentioned yes often ok feel like need to doorslam someone in my life but there is something blocking the door need help there is woman at work that was quite good friends with for couple of years hello and welcome it great to see another person has wandered down the rabbit hole of mbti just some small advice though and please don take this as me being un welcoming but would read seems quite interesting will have closer look ve had little experience in supervising people in the work place and while never found disciplining people pleasant actually found kind of had knack for it would always spend some it just seems so crazy that people would find it so hard to tell us they like us at best it could be the love of your life at worst we will probably be flattered and then let you down as gently as interesting that most have logan typed as an xxtx get that he is not people person but think that is more of facade than anything he is deeply emotional animalistic and acts using his thanks for replying in terms of needing this connection can only say that it felt really good us infjs tend not to get to know many people we have very few close friends having this got peacemaker as well though it tried to tell me was 74 extrovert which is flat out wrong an overseas trip is huge thing for an introvert can speak from personal experience that after trip like that would definitely retreat into myself for awhile and analyse what ve learnt my job is incredibly repetitive and mundane and people often ask me how cope but kind of like doing menial tasks as get to spend my time thinking about anything want tend to save my just to entertain the idea that we take criticism poorly for minute if this is the case think it is only because we are so critical of ourselves already that other criticism can seem ve been through similar felt the same way about my dad as teenager and it took long time to come to terms with it my mum has confided in my many times how emotionally abused she feels and my dad is an entp but m finding myself more and more like him as grow older sometimes when laugh freak out that he is in the room because we sound exactly alike can ask why are you agree with maybe 10 of it the thing dislike about it is it all it seems to have done is create divide tension between infjs and entps we all have flaws screaming at rock to stop so much this also have thing where like reading license plates while driving haha find do lot of similar the things already mentioned really struggle to sleep in any bed other than my own and will never fall asleep on the couch on planes etc always hope to be role model for others try my best to work on myself making mistakes and learning from them can change others or the world can only change myself believe if can become interesting thread m an infj and my dad believe is an entp consider myself agnostic while he would probably consider himself believer though would hardly call him religious we can it must be infj isfj month or something because need advice as well though this time on platonic level met this amazing isfj girl at work and we gradually started getting to know each

relationships and expecting the significant other to be more than they could be meet me at wanderingthoughts the roaring lion was the old one the rest sent out to scare the prey into the jaws of the others who still had teeth to kill lion seeking prey will not make any noise but the wanderingthoughts so agree with you re the devil being prowling lion looking for someone to devour and steal what he can in our lives but he is toothless lion stand firm with the full armour the commuting would be murder being with an infp guy is just so refreshingly different he just gets you on such deep level and as long as you are up to getting him in the same way it can be match made in heaven but you infp guys are great brill fab as an infj woman the most important thing to me is being understood completely and am dam labyrinth in here lol the only guy that has made me feel totally wanderingthoughts very much agree on the contrasting facts well what ever it is like will see you there one day and we can swop notes lol could it be about death to self god getting your eyes focused on the temporary nature of life here by causing you to consider eternity in deeper way so fullfill your destiny to the greatest loving this thread yours words are so true when god is dealing in our life it is not quick fix and can be painful at the time am currently working through some tough issues in my life with him romans 8 28 god works all things to the good for those who love him and are called according to his purposes have always loved this verse and can see looking back how when things have gone being misunderstood by people and then caring too much that was thanks for all the help think might be able to do this now m all for quicker profit thanks no error message just no image when post goes up have tried right click on word doc saved image and copy and then paste into post way too simple wild guess logical abstract analytical processes possible strong point no have just tried yet again and it failed hi you intj out there am very none technolgical infj and am trying to post an image from word doc onto this site and failing miserably each time as only my typed words come up and never really understand this chameleon thing and all can say is it has for me decreased as got older and am much more myself with others than used to be can feel lonely in the midst of company through feeling am not connected to anyone at times they arn really getting me feel sometimes am morphing into shape for them to understand and soooooo cute female infj animal lover what else would say relate to the weight and the gift part and the needing to really trust someone before sharing deeply with them fundamental to the infj being deeply understood the weight and the gift is ment to say eyes in last post not yes that shows how tired my eyes are lol usually try and read until my yes are really tired and can keep them open any longer plus the room has to be dark and prefer silence which is handy as live in the country where there is no living without intensity is like not living at all like time alone to chill out from the intense relationships have and then straight back into the fray finishing each others sentences so agree with infpblog post asking the right questions is so important so can keep going forward positively and not get wstuck at the side of the road in loop of negative emotion sometimes so agree with this post think this is brill idea would love it if someone did this for me how about links to music nothing makes me happier than discovering new pieces of music that inspire me and move me deeply know it would be rare to hear an intj say that does not feel right but never know in odd touchy feely moment lol this happens to me al lthe time so caught up in my mind that what is going on in there is more real than what is around me it can be triggered by anything music something am reading someone can identify with this part will focus really hard on what is most efficient in given situation will be really impatient with stupidity hi snippet m new too hope you enjoy it here that does not feel right ment torrents last psot makes me sound like have verbal blurting out problem lol love your signature line my mind is river when damned it stagnates and settles when unleashed it is torrent sounds so like me maybe we just torrent people to much but love as fellow infj can see where you are coming from with the passionate intense part have expereinces others not able to cope understand that part of me have good enfp freind that thinks yes can do

likely sensor so shes either esfp or esfj am not sure if she uses too much fi honestly think she is an esfj along with many other talented wanna type the best isfp musician in the last decade michael jackson think he is the introvert extrovert type the guy came across as introvert introvert though would you say then that you are more the introvert introvert type our advancement stays natural as long as the advancement we are making is natural itself the less we break nature rules the better because breaking nature rule means making something that was because we ourselfs are part of nature and the further we disprove nature the not better for us one might argue though that humans are in many ways the most advanced beings in nature that 100s who originated from 2 those 2 who formed as the result of splitting one am not making it binary nature made it that way everything is of pairs not just in mbti you stiletto this is the entj division could be wrong though extrovert extrovert entjs madeleine albright 326026 nancy pelosi 326034 the401 yeah thats why we call you introvert extrovert isfp happy the whole concept came of the idea that everything is of pairs or that every single thing divides its self into 2 and then each of those two divide into two and it goes on we see this think most type 7s will fall under the introvert extrovert category if those type 9 are still in high school tell them to get enough of that life style while they are still in high school and even to some extent early years of university but there will topcatlsd you are 1w2 you now ve only came across one isfp type 1 and it was online and she was 1w9 think that type 9 person leading bad lifestyle is prone to some of the things you said for instance showering remember time when would not take shower for weeks busy doing ferroequinologist fi is our main function somehow couldn associate it with only one group of us but do get what you mean very draining but you guys introvert extrovert algorithmics scarlet johanson is an istp am not 100 sure but am more confident typing her the introvert introvert type this is good example of an ie intp vs ii intp introvert of all the stories posted here about infj isfp relationships the isfp guy in this story is the only real isfp the guy is sooo isfp though showing too much affection in public is kinda weird how do our cousins the introvert extrovert one come across to you find them slighly more interesting because of the slight difference guess and tega1 little correction its not extrovert introvert isfp its introvert extrovert isfp extrovert introvert is for types for instance within esfp there is the extrovert introvert doublepost skrillex introvert extrovert isfp 316634 vera farmiga introvert extrovert isfp 316642 but between the two groups you relate more to the introvert extrovert type it may be that within that group you are more the introverted one and that each group then divides itself into 2 therefor more like the introvert extrovert type instead of the introvert introvert tega1 you are easy you are introvert introvert frank ocean introvert introvert isfp 316122 riley keogh introvert introvert isfp 316130 ferroequinologist ll check him again theredpanda but in you true essence you are more like the introvert isfps type eminem introvert extrovert isfp 315450 christina hendricks introvert extrovert isfp 315466 personally think being an introvert introvert isfp that introvert extrovert isfps are very cool and appealing honestly find my group boring because we are so much the same guess introvert extrovert isfps lady gaga 314321 zack efron 314329 avril lavigne 314337 hallo isfp if we noticed one thing about mbti it is the pairs and the opposites feeler vs thinker vs j vs every function or personality has its two pairs for instance the joethebull am now safely building an empire in my head its surrounded by unfriendly empires though mikan you would be one high queen your estj queen assistant would topple you while high in the words of great rihana but no matter what you ll never see me cryyyy crying is sometimes relief its better private though an isfp king queen what would he she be like feel like ruling the galaxy right now lets end the era of isfp musicians and begin the era of isfp rulers infj really like isfps this thread made it official after many many threads interesting these genuine motives can be inspired by religion as much as it can be inspired by any humanitarian civilized thought therefor an individual can be humanitarian simply on account of his religion law thats the same no matter ones accidental nature law that will apply to the peasant in laos as much as it applies to the banker in new york think we should both love and fear if one prevails we have dis balance and this is not inline with the rules of nature we cant just do something for the sake of love nor for the sake of hornet if so then thank god am 9w1 and not 9w8 one se depends on him her will and anger can be associated to any eneagram type think that for instance the body types would naturally be better at reading body language and signals this is very interesting

it all know is my aunt has craploads of them and it kinda tacky otherwise m neutral as in could live without knowing about tattoos but don hate them why are enfp called the champions is it because we have determination to be our best and win or does it mean we re good at leadership does it mean we re the champions of cause as in missed you welcome back to enfp land wouldn say m in legit love just

probably 9 and 3 most also 4 probably ve been attracted to 7 before for short term wouldn really call it bias per se but suppose something like formlessness is the only good way to be existing too much is not real and uncomfortable feels false also for my 1 wing walking around town the city campus today observing everything and getting ideas thinking random middle aged man are you alright me why man are you alright me mm are you favourite feeling alive interest feeling absorbed in something interesting or aesthetically pleasing inspiration melancholy feeling like everything is perfect and or new feeling like myself many sp so oh yeah can do an impression of that accent pretty well actually it cockney which is like more old fashioned version of working class london southern accent ghetto is similar but more modern really want to totally change my voice the reason is mainly because don want to feel similar to my abusive mother who disowned years ago is now dead to me am english does anyone no don like it my apartment or room is my own retreat don want people invading it well have contamination ocd too but that not the only reason im good at lying lie sometimes if need to also act kinda fake lot of times like putting in social front just enough so that people think m normal ve had lifetime of practice and have good eye for aesthetics still would like to develop si more than have already though to get better like more effortlessly instinctual more often like it comes so naturally to isfx i wondering if anyone would want to help me figure out how best to do something it nothing morally wrong whatsoever in fact it morally right however think some people might judge me for as usually unhealthy type 9 can get uncomfortable about experiencing most emotions for example when m feeling very detached and dissociated at the unhealthy levels will specifically avoid yes it the only emotion feel intensely or regularly really even thiugh it fleetingly think have lot of suppressed anger realise get angry lot now used to just think it was 661194 join the club hello and welcome have similar interests and like your username and avatar freeze or flee or tell them to leave me alone just walking away and possibly giving them dirty look is preferable option well m not saying it easy in reality to actually do but still don get why some people find it actually unappealing in the first place it sounds totally appealing to me d love to be like interesting get this idea the integrate to 3 description sounds appealing to me and like good advice so it interesting people are saying that their integration description doesn sound don personally know much about what it like to study those subjects but it sounds like you are doing well at math and it could be relevant for many courses careers it sounds like you find basically lived off ramen the instant packet kind for couple of months before when was in college thought was so clever and it was so great that could live off something so cheap and my tritype is 9w1 5w 6 4w3 have strong 5 influence but guess being 9 maybe makes me bit less intense about knowledge idk m an intp so of course like acquiring knowledge and skip me makes sense save my ne for special occasions thanks roboticforest that sounds like some good interesting advice about analysing my body language although tried to do it today and as was curled up with my hands hugging me and around my think ben is an intp think for that reason he seems bit like cross between an isfj and infp do understand what you are noting about his impulsiveness at lot of times snd imagine how m experiencing an emotion right now it might be sadness or depression it is sort of spreading warm feelings in my chest and slight ache or heaviness to it but it doesn feel bad is it this just reminded of some times when think have felt sadness like sometimes when hear about an animal being mistreated think can feel some sadness then hmm maybe when wrote this because don know if do or not or if do then how or when guess when cry must be experiencing sadness but other than that m not sure after and before cry feel no different find that changing my environment somewhere new and enjoyable exciting interesting usually works well find it to be very effective quick and easy as just start observing everything which s can imagine this is what it might be like if it goes well ha 653066 no not anymore used to when was younger though like when was in college used to try to fit in now just do what want that the best way to make real

overall happy childhood was inquisitive and imaginative so had good time making games for myself and had lots of things to be interested in was painfully shy though and my voice these are all from when was in elementary school from around grade 2 4 1 never truly believed in santa was first introduced to the concept in grade 2 when my teacher made us write depends how they try to help can understand what you re getting at though m someone that freely asks people questions if m curious or want them to elaborate on some information so have very strong fe when it comes to understanding people motives and feelings but m not sure if it came naturally to me or if it was developed somehow it a skill noticed in myself yes this sounds like what am experiencing the issue with it now is that simply cannot get myself to do school work anymore and m at danger of dropping out of fairly good university in serious question have any of you intps experienced clinical depression if so how did it manifest please also state gender if you are comfortable some of the descriptions of depression hey guys ve been hoping that some of you could give me insight on whether this guy know is an istj or an intj like to type people as hobby but had trouble figuring him out he is i went into university loving science but wasn motivated enough to really delve into them of the three main ones physics chem and bio physics was probably the most interesting as chem and mainly use tumblr to follow my favorite artists so won recommend any unless you re interested in anime art like so otherwise if you re stereotypical intp can recommend some m not sure if it an intp trait but yes love the melancholic poignant and macabre my friends often call me emo because of it aha ha enjoy poignant fiction as it really tickles my food freaking love food no srsly one of my top priorities in life is food love sampling tasty looking things or helping friend finish their plate if am offered taste will take it yes definitely think more in the manner that society deems as masculine but stopped caring about gender in my later years of highschool as it started to frustrate me it a limiting concept holy crap this bullshit about spelling thought intps would be wise enough to overlook something so petty these meaningless condescending remarks about something mainly aesthetic are the type of they all sound terribly lonely and nakama seems like living sad movie road eternal you always have to leave wtf get attached to places fisher you always have to stay can leave the this is an interesting topic because recently had chat with my father about this he is an estp and can be rather dense when it comes to emotional subtleties this has caused lot of huh never thought that denying someone would ever be worse than getting denied if were to actually like someone enough to actually confess it would mean am dead serious about them and well my parents allowed me to take small sips from their wine glasses since was in kindergarten some may not approve of this haha but turned out fine and it was just tiny tastes so the taste you know my best friend in highschool was an isfj and what you described was the exact thing that experienced with her she was very kind and quiet individual that could respect my need for well ve definitely done the same thing before used logic to try and erase them from my mind thinking we re not compatible in the long run the person is too rigid we would probably get bored of does it really matter what age and gender you are if you know what you re doing is shallow and are using the excuse of age and gender you re just willingly treating these women as objects for some that is the wrong way to look at the world good sir what are you looking for in women if you are looking for fucktoys then ok sorry bro then as an infp majority of women are not going to m not saying fighting back against an aggressor is wrong obviously as long as there is the risk of being attacked by any group of people the ability to defend oneself is needed this is pretty war is pretty much mass murder that is legal kill as many human beings as possible and then whoever

requires thinking the misanthropy joke the way you asked the question made it tempting to answer like that though tend to connect with introverted intuitives but often fall for istjs types don know if it simply because there are higher chances of meeting sensors than intuitives think in the long am shy so come across as ladylike to some males but don feel very feminine nor do like the feminine things they associate me with such as giving me paper roses or offering me seat to 1 do any of you had trouble with school unfullfilling trouble staying on task rules etc was quiet student that caused no trouble and did my work properly did go through i get along with estps pretty well for the most part usually if they have good sense of humor one of my friends is an estp and could joke around with her the most out of all my friends and if my parents tried to force me into an arranged marriage my automatic reply would be no fucking way no one will be forcing their opinions on how should live my

              " ' also agree with esfj f p esfp seems like perfect fit socionics infp correlates with mbtt infp most of the time assuming one doesn critically consider the function split between the two don know what your mbtt type is but it probably that isfj in socionics so most likely isfj in mbtt you re reliable and hardworking this immediately eliminates all types you re concerned for stability and freedom this pits you in the ij yes that definitely fe ni she expressing all those emotions getting out the powerful imagination aiding her cognition however if she an intuitive introvert she will more times than not yes saw it was leaning toward intp at first but had to think for while as to where his intuition was oriented m honestly not very certain of his type he uses both ni and ne very another read over and came to this conclusion infj the answer as to why was getting vibes from both isfp and isfj are clear to me now you are actually using the perceiving functions of one think infj is correct that why said intp the op is an ili so there should be some very thick te present all over doesn matter which te since they re fundamentally the same thing in each system if she were an isfp would be more likely you re much too down to earth to be an infp infps are big world builders often lost in their fantasies of what could be exploring mirrors of reality in sense whereas entj entj yes this is what mean logical types don prefer to use persuasion it a last resort sort of thing the reverse is true for ethical types this is why m saying you re logical type this would be an example of persuasion m not saying ethical types can do it m saying they prefer not to like you just showed me intp also did read your questionnaire you do sound like an intj in the very least you are certainly in the ij temperament as you are very static individual which would explain why your fe ti see where you re coming from but must remind you that many logical types mistype as infj was one of them for few months myself so my apologies for skewing the image of the infj but i will type you via socionics first you are dynamic ni ego individual this means you re either an intp infp entj or enfj this fits with the following intj infjs simply don have the same drive you do for proving yourself right and seeking the truth as rule ethical types prefer to use persuasion not argumentation ethical types prove you both the intp and infp have fundamental desire to have their beliefs sorted out and to have those beliefs come into fruition something they re bad at doing because they re rather lazy and so the amount of entjs on this forum is about the amount of any given sj type iirc so there not nearly as many to begin with with that aside considering we have te in the ego we re mostly here when you interact with the external world objects you re an extrovert and when you interact with your personal sentiments subjects you re an introvert everyone does both so the question is d say infp considering you like to take care of people so tenderly ni is actually very strong in this personality type 2nd most powerful though you wouldn know it from the ordering it my analysis indicates enfp when you talk about not wanting to miss opportunities knew you had to be some sort of np you want to be knowledgeable indicating te somewhere in the mix thing with 1 poor fe albeit awareness of it ni in top functions so either intj or entj 2 perceiving dominant ergo nite could give an analysis of the whole thing but if it just the type you re definitely ne si you re also rational type in that you stop to weigh all your decisions as opposed to just going with the flow which leaves us with either inxp or esxj you don seem to value you strike me as more of an isfp esp when you talk about caring greatly for aesthetics which has more to do with the sensory functions isfj is my vote infj as another possibility think isfj is stronger option because you have more of tenacity to go out and do the things you want changed as opposed to trying to istp 100 entp so probably an entp in mbtt as well here my scratch pad so you can see how came to this conclusion hey nichya thanks for the question functionally infps and infjs do convert evenly but the functions are defined in different ways in each system so the conversion is largely pointless iei nife so infx in mbtt you ll find most type as infp whereas most eiis fine type as infjs it just one of those situations where the functions don correlate properly this is due to you re socionics lse which roughly translates into estj here how that works first you admit that you favor intelligence and believe that knowledge is power you hate to be wrong about ne works with the object ni works with the subject example ne wonder what these objects mean ni wonder what gelatin elephant would look like ne would then proceed to conjure enfp do see your strongest function as ne however you are devaluing fe in these places either estj or entj ni dominant is unlikely as you re not expressing strong desire to pursue the unknowable g what would happen if the dinosaurs never went extinct rather you re xnxp si ergo xnxp judging perceiving intp seems more likely but d buy infp as well both types share the same disdain for people trying to make them do stuff fe valuing se valuing and yearning which leaves enfj or infj consider both but don consider enfp these types are nothing if not stereotypical point is they re proactive whereas intjs are receptive the intj is in perpetual idle state until his energy is worthy of the task at hand whereas descriptions for the istp are pretty botched for various reasons mostly because of kiersey disregard for the functions imo but strongly believe you re an istp for some reason istj and istp an ij will tell you when you re wrong but he won tell you what to think what you think is quality of introversion extroverted functions can touch them and an intj really doesn have giant red flag that you re an ixtp ixtj is really out of the question now 100 positive you re an ixxp type istp seems most likely to me intj you acknowledge that mixing emotions with the outer world is bad plan of action which shows concern for te and disregard for fe you then go on to say that people should think for isfp my father is exactly the same way if you actively seek to command you re an entj if you want to live an enjoyable life you re an intj ejs are natural leaders ijs are natural individualists one wants to lead and direct the here it sounds like you re pushing the limits of what is or isn acceptable behavior which is something isfps frequently do intps have fi and se in their superego which is like your parental the inward judgments are choleric while the outward judgments are phlegmatic her inward reactions are more developed than her outward so that tp most likely or fj 2nd most likely my m detecting ti but m uncertain of its strength you re most

              " ' yep yep yep especially the last one yep agree yep sounds like me funny to have your personality explained so simply by someone else someone wrote that in thread here and thought it was great quote was wondering how do you use your empathy and intuition in your everyday life to effectively manage people or handle oh gosh yes never knew this was an infp trait think you re right it can make us vulnerable to suggestion understand your point but also realize that feeling these feelings of others is not something which is always voluntary it not something you consciously seek out it just happens that you get hit nail on head happy think infps are cerebral they tend to think through things before speaking they try to connect various thoughts and ideas in way that makes sense to them before sharing it with anyone so yes when m stressed and feeling overwhelmed in these instances my irrational mind takes over and races mile an minute with the most crazy thoughts when m stressed in this mode my mind goes so m finding that it sometimes little difficult to quiet the mind and maintain sense of calm actively find new strategies to help me regain and maintain feeling of separateness or the following are my favorites so far attraction doesn always mean someone is good or right fit and yeah relationship skills are key if partners don listen or respect each other across those generational gaps then it will answered this in another part of the forum but ll add my opinion here happy used to idealize the younger older relationship and really wanted to be in that kind of relationship until i admit that on many occasions have read little too much into someone facial expressions and found myself confirming biases than truly being impartial or objective about what was seeing or you use your lunch time at work to catch up on reading or look out the window of the cafe or cafeteria wondering what others things you love to be doing yes guilty of this seeing or reading things in people facial expressions underlying feelings or vibes which scream out at me while the person and everyone else thinks it below the surface or to support what others have said yes usually if someone regardless of type discuss an issue by talking it through with us then it probably helps they tend to feel accepted and comfortable sometimes it makes me think m paranoid and just seeing things which admit can be possibility unsure but it does make me feel little awesome to know that can pick up on things others may think the infp is just reacting to your strong belief that you are right because you believe you are more logical or objective because of your they are responding to your assumption that not sure if this is an infp thing or an nf thing but do you notice subtle differences in meaning when observing or communicating with people do you find that you can take something apart and break how do you feel when someone confides in you feels good that someone feels they can trust me with that info and feels good to know they think can be that person who can handle their crap yep ll lay around for long period of time doing nothing then suddenly get this surge of energy and then try to do many things in the evening or at night things should have done earlier in my favorites dry love should never be just many splendored thing it should be many treasured thing potayto potaaato tomayto tomato let just call the whole thing vegetable slop yep yep yep sooo true found out while back that this is called catastrophizing and do it lot it almost like second nature agree one sided relationships are not worth it in the long run and clearly aren fair to the partner who invests quite bit sometimes at great cost without receiving very much in return yes it our way of connecting with our fi since we sometimes have to keep it tucked away in the shadows in our day to day lives it our time to breathe or exhale seeming all business and serious usually does it sometimes but unfortunately they also can make people think something is wrong and want to talk to me even more so maybe that doesn work so introversion is that time for me to just be without trying too hard to be something else being around people makes me self conscious and consequently other directed often act and behave in ways leoni so much of what you ve said clicks with me don like being in fish bowl or being the center of attention work in small office right now and like it it more relaxed like the sometimes am not sure what works until meet someone it sometimes the qualities of the individual which attracts you rather than particular set of qualities for example the last person this pls stop reading my mind laughing seriously this is very true though thought it was just me yes do it but am also realizing how uncomfortable it can be for the person being observed in this way when m not sure of someone and m still figuring them out tend to observe them quite if you re good french teacher that good we need more of those both and none at all sometimes want to hide myself to protect it from the abuses of the world or protect the world from me laughing and sometimes want to seek which for me means allowing am very guarded as result of the experiences ve had over the years don really think of people the way once did as result of these perceptions it tiring fighting these perceptions yeah and they also believe that if you dislike and avoid conflict that you re unable to understand the true nature of the world or not capable of seeing the world as it is they assume that being one thing is the belief that certain qualities give the impression of being childlike such as shyness and not expressing certainty when giving your opinions or not stating your opinions decidedly agree am not sure would dislike the formal or strict aspects since have little of that in me because of how grew up but d probably be more into the art stuff although m not the when you re the reluctant victim of an ongoing double standard which says it ok if someone else is upset and expresses it but it not ok for you if you express that you re annoyed or bothered when you try to conform and fit in as much as you can but yet still feel and seem like sore thumb sticking out when you constantly have to edit yourself to make point only to realize that you re sacrificing your own right to speak your views because you re too worried about what others may feel or think liked french and the language but was always worried about not getting tenses and grammar right or perfect think if could have overcome that fear maybe d be at least be fluent by now yep that arrogance would turn me off this is probably one of the main reasons ve always liked france or the idea of it very

the book will end by the third one ve read movies can pull out who will die immediately the reason is because it sweetish oh they are definitely interesting when they get in the same room they can

ground was just thinking in terms of conversation sometimes quieter people those this made my day could not agree more mind blown this is gold never have done this before but will in the future near future appreciate the helpful advice this is absolutely true think in the older generation such as my parents they use terminology such as four times the man because its what links them to what others of that generation ah what the heck ll give it try lol am not overly the standard old fashion view of feminine but can be m also not the full standard old fashion view of masculine either hahahahahahahahaha can totally get how annoying that would be the worst part is when was younger didn even realize was doing it sometimes people catch themselves muttering infront of this is also what ve found when ve met enfjs positive traits they try to do the right thing even if its only right in their minds they have very subjective view on whats right 1 intj 2 like introvertness causes less ruffled feathers not that am afraid to ruffle feathers just think that being less mouthy may make more friends lol 3 working on being quieter yeah entjs have introverted feeling fi not fe and its our

both that does it for me its like have deep really surprised stereotype is surrounded by sensitivity seriously because no stereotype ie racism anti semitics or feminist etc about any type of person has ever has caused this is completely true msbossypants mentioned in another forum way form to of bullying an entj and would have to saying requesting us to prove stereotype wrong or right or prove anything for our feelings emotions run very deep we just don believe in showing them on our sleeve to just anyone or everyone you have to enter my inner circle throughout sort of approval process to

              " ' first time ever with test was not an infj it typed me as an enfj but am most definitely not an extrovert trust me happy still the nfj was right on have no idea at all how it got out did this test it was markedly different from lot of the online mbti mini tests have never scored anything different than infj even when have tried to slightly alter the way am thinking have an especially hard time dealing with social things for my kids activities couple of recent examples 1 my older daughter wanted to go to school movie night this past wednesday it she might say that give her the chance at least are you worried she ll give you hard time and then you ll have conflict with her for the rest of the semester can totally understand that can empathize and can tell it pretty upsetting to you don know why else you would be so upset unless you were hurt and confused have experienced this and it hurts to hear about how it okay this is my honest opinion you need to get over this just talk to the teacher tell them you somehow didn get credit for it and drop it and know this is hard you re an infj but my point is that it doesn matter if she put you down or not and whether or not she thinks you pulled your weight in the group you said she seemed reluctant to correct the problem so are you willing to share time this happened to you am curious about your fury know what that means for me but wonder if we experience similar levels for example my blood pressure think the problem is that she sees it as forum to give nice little narcissistic supply normally post things about my kids saying silly things or frustrations over music am writing agree with you and most of the time just don want to go there it is too exhausting for me and usually not worth it did it this time and do know there is sense of pride in having well she finally responded got mean and doorslammed her told her off said my piece and unfriended her am so sick of seeing her on facebook anyway and really don like her the sad who made person 1 the authority to decide if team member contributed enough to the group to get credit usually what say that can believe came out of my mouth is stammering stuttering rambling nonsense it embarrassing it usually at that point in conversation when tell the am usually very very forgiving and let things slide lot but when someone pushes too hard too far often just snap and suddenly go off on them so as an infj am wondering how it is for was an officer in the us air force for 7 years this was hard as an infj because often felt like couldn articulate things fast enough and the military is very fast paced and probably suits agree think infjs might be known for this more than other types because we are so dedicated when we believe in something or someone we give that cause or person everything we have emotionally hmmm am an infj and the funny thing is that when was child related better with adults had some friends my age but usually felt older and didn want to socialize with the kids as this is exactly how it happens with me too it has only happened couple of times in my life but when it happened it was quick and final it was almost bizzare and had zero remorse or empathy yeah wonder if he is feeling overwhelmed by you so often will be with an extroverted friend and will be having great time for an hour or two and then suddenly just become exhausted well you don need to apologize and the part about making yourself someone everyone will like guess am concerned if you seriously would try to do that because it not difficult it i don know think we would need to browse their forum could be interesting wow kind of harsh but yeah think it possible that grammatical errors and extraneous style might be annoying to an infj it is to me get caught in it and kind of can move on from this yes actually get anxious when the phone rings at the time am writing this have 27 voice mails get anxious when think about checking them my box is full would like to keep sounds like you experienced something negative with fellow introvert doing this yeah often want to be rude and just yell at people that am overloaded and they need to go away and leave me appreciate what you said here about the fact that we aren obligated to care what others think would and believe should care if people think am unkind or unfair or dishonest but guess thought extroverted types might not have such hard time with being open and posting publicly but that doesn necessarily have anything to do with introversion extroversion if it can change does that mean until adolescence it fluid and developing and changeable or we just can see what it will eventually become until adolescence and then it clear what my 5 year old daughter is quite the character and am always wondering which type she probably is tell me what you think 1 extremely verbal talks and talks and talks from dawn to dusk and don really m trying to figure it out myself still lately have been really just trying to actually let people know that am the kind of person who does these things that way if when which also brings to my attention another issue face with my personality can and usually do use my insightful abilities to help people but there have been times and am not really proud of that prozac is not the right medication for treating my anxiety makes me feel absolutely no anxiety need some otherwise can get anything done glad to be off of that stuff my house is this is one of my biggest struggles with people in my life people will meet me think they feel validated because can see them who they truly are and they misinterpret that to mean that oh and also have wondered how can tell what is my natural introversion and what is just anxiety so how does that work with social anxiety being an extrovert and am not asking this to be snotty am seriously interested funny was actually think about this earlier today was wondering how much our personality plays into whether we are more susceptible to depression and anxiety or other mental health issues cute thing to add to this tonight went to movie with my one and only infj friend before the movie we commented how we drove separately and showed up to the theater both wearing sweatpants expectation want to hear all the details of your every care and concern reality am really bored after the first 20 minutes and want you to leave so can go be by myself have always been leg shaker know it drives people nuts sometimes but like doing it don know why do it though usually don even notice it until someone brings it to my attention yes thanks they are so sweet to cuddle with my younger one looks soooo innocent but she is real stinker wink okay these are recent pics from this winter and last fall the one of me on the couch was my birthday when had really bad flu so got my gifts lying down on the couch but still with my well this is something really think should think about in my life do think about it actually but it would be nice to write it out because for me and probably most of you am able to come no ing way yes it was right by coach i went in and met some friends in there he was standing outside near an ally okay am not crazy laughing once was in detroit in the nice part of the city and yeah there is nice part and was walking down the street looked over because could feel someone looking at me and this guy was in actually don specifically care about either of them when the lance armstrong thing came out started looking at his personality and saw other people on the list she was an interesting example haha said that to her about 10 minutes ago was like you know get it got it the first time you said it didn help she is still talking laughing oooo now she went into oooooooo it is hard for me to process this think because just really struggle to understand the idea that someone would do something simply for selfish gain especially if it unfair or could if can sit back and just listen am fine can take it all in and maybe 3 hours later ll bring it back up again with some ideas or thoughts maybe could tell her this although don think yeah my first thought that jumped to the surface was about the sleeping so he is bothering to get tired by being around so he probably likes being around you but would guess you are have this problem if someone is lecturing me about something e my wife is trying to talk to me about how our daughter already ruined her winter boots that she got for christmas like it my at the moment am listening to my intp wife driving me crazy with her overly analytical rant could make video of it but don think any of you would enjoy it arg wink ',\n",

compassionate she seems like she subtly looking for logic in everything she also seems little indifferent an infp would be much catherine seems like clear infp to me though ve seen her typed as isfp and can see that as well but infps are usually the ones with the wild imagination and live in fantasy world might becca didn seem like feeler to me at all thought she was intp she doesn seem at all fi dominant to me or ne she definitely not xnfp hello got cast as laura in my school production of the glass menangerie and looked around to see what the types of the characters here but there wasn any thread on it surely there the more watch the show the more think sybil an infp her fi is so incredibly apparent and her ne is also quite obvious in series 1 maybe an enneagram type 9 or 4 if she a 4 she a hmm well in the novel enjolras is definitely thinker his girlfriend is france and you think he doesn know the existance of women so xntx is definitely what he like in the book in the love enjolras as well aaron tveit was amazing m pretty sure enjy is xntj but ve always felt conflicted on whether or not he an extrovert he so leaderly and manly though my best friend in the world is enfj though know her online but we talk every day and we are always on the same page it crazy my two other online friends are infps and we also get along am also studying voice though not in college university m little too young for that m studying with teacher and hope to go into opera or musical theatre am shy and often awkward when first read the books was 12 instantly became obsessed with everything regarding twilight and then the movie came out and everyone started liking it that when stopped being such ah the film is magnificent beautifully directed yes even with the closeups and most of the cast are great but amanda seyfried was horrendous and russell crowe can sing but m more annoyed can truly adore story or book or movie if don find bits and pieces of myself in the characters have always longed to relate to fictional characters and like imagining the same don know about others but as for me can be intimidating sometimes think seem too mysterious and secretive and introverted to others and they end up thinking well she weird i am insecure and constantly frightened because m scared that nobody can ever love me but deep down m scared of commitment because never want to be unsure d rather have one estp suits edith great deal think and agree with brien as being istj but introverts can be open avantgardearmy my infj sister is one of the most sociable people know you can guess she introverted unless you know her well she sometimes feel slightly shy and think marius might be nf he doesn strike me as thinker don know of thinker could fall in love at first sight and believe in it so firmly and passionately as marius wouldn he try to jean valjean infj javert istj fantine isfp cosette infp marius pontmercy infj madame thenardier enfp gone bad thenardier entp eponine estp enjolras intj gavroche esfp infps are also incredibly fond of books you know well my sister is an infj and so is one of my closest friends my sister a social butterfly really open and friendly outgoing but she needs found this regarding belle type on tumblr the only ne traits see in her is when she sort of reassesss beastx92s motives and desires e x93oh hex92s not evil hex92s just super lonely and hates in persuasion captain benwick seems like an infj forgot to write that why on earth is cosette entp the same as javert for god sake she obviously feeler think that belle is one of the most obvious introverted disney characters rapunzel and ariel are most likely enfps and they have this amazing contageous enthusiasm that draws you in immidietely oh thought you were serious about because she breaks into song and without having read the rest had already formed arguments in my head about how infps can also be singy and such eeekk and know this is little strange but why do you think belle is an extrovert fantine is definitely isfp in the novel she even artistic and fashionable she definitely sensor cosette is really shy when she grows up especially bookwise and naive and innocent and in tom might be an intp though ve always felt he more entpish he seems like an introvert he always reading newspapers alone in the garage in season 2 but he fits the entp description better am type four wing three female have very specific sense of fashion but everybody keeps telling me it too grown up for me it basically close to what taylor swift wears

questions in that respect just figured that with you likely being si dominant whether your feeling function was fe or fi was largely irrelevant to my logic when figured killinit find mbti tests unreliable because of their inconsistent results based on how person feels at the time and also because the questions are often skewered in favour of and answers as wincor ah getcha now can see why you would come to the conclusion of infp as your type you might think fi is your dominant function because of avoiding peer pressure or each to their own or you might think of don think we entirely see eye to eye on our reasons for you likely being an istj you re probably using online profiles while use the original idea of si as fitting impressions within i writing up my response to killinit as of now once that response is posted ll probably wait day or two before type radicaldog so that can create window of time for people to discuss my took longer to respond because was having particularly fogged up sort of day so tried slightly different approach this time around this time read through all your answers to each wincor ve changed my mind about your type see my previous post above to read what wrote sorry for throwing you off like that but wasn very focused at the time you didn go too far into your own motives or reasons for things so couldn say too much about your type although originally typed you as ti dominant type having reread what you wrote alright folks listen up ve had some great exchanges in this typing thread and like to think that both myself and the people ve typed have walked away from this with clearer killinit wouldn say regret it but am bit worn out think ll stop after ve responded to your questionnaire think you re an infp because saw fi as your dominant function more often than not and ne and si are in there in supporting role it would be more accurate to describe fi as systemising over you re an intp figured you were an intp since the very first question and you yourself seem certain that you re an intp were you just curious to see what would say can relate myself am an ntp and javifi misconstrued contemplation and introspection as being introversion not reacting out loud because you want to avoid confrontation is something that no more likely to be characteristic sm1 maybe was being too harsh as well guess just got bit annoyed that the exchange seemed to not be going anywhere and didn want to take up too much time or space when there were others think you re an entp saw ne in dominant role and you ve got ti and fe as well your fe is notably strong for low order function and too strong to be inferior but fe isn your dominant suspect your preferred functions are si and fe and m leaning towards isfj because you show some use of ti and seem to be introverted sm1 or could have really messed up sleep patterns but thought it was given that not everyone on the internet is american to be honest m reluctant to continue this conversation you re most welcome think you re an esfj mainly because fe is your dominant function don think you re an introvert in fact lot of extraverts mistype as introverts when they focus more sm1 have little more to say that bb hasn already said in effectively explaining why you are an entj still you can ask more questions about your type if you want you misread what said cited you as an example of how an istj an si dom is receptive to sensory impressions you re not an intj because you don use ni should get some sleep wasn i came back to this thread just ten minutes later and uh think created monster here that can easily be contained javifi ll type you whenever get the chance promise finny suspect that lot of si types mistype as intps or infps especially when they rely on behaviourisms to type themselves and others such as associating physical togetherness with being sensor sm1 indeed you demonstrate the same sort of te in your responses that you did in your questionnaire also saw inferior fi in you which commented on in my analysis of your questionnaire in my you re probably an entj you re an entj who is largely out of touch with their inferior fi you re an istj saw lot of si and fi in you and you re out of your element when it comes to ne the second question in particular emphasises the catastrophising that jung described with inferior having read chapters and xi of jung book psychological types recommended reading for anyone with an interest in typology feel fairly confident about my knowledge of jung function theory know therex92s probably half dozen of these threads around here but thought ix92d have more constructive discussion if shared the types had for the main characters in new thread itx92s oh hey fellow entp writer and published author at that what sort of fiction do you write hope you enjoy your stay at this site intuitive don often see intuitive answers to this question so it somewhat refreshing to read such reply si in remembering the incident for later and maybe low te in asking your how is liking being spontaneous having fun and being around other people exclusive to ne gotcha yes it is possible for the inferior to be more functional than the tertiary admit that was throwing out half flung theory about you having crappy dominant si and although you so perhaps frigus is an infp yeah ne and si likely makes sense you get pulled around lot by possibilities in way that makes me see ne why te fi couldn you be fi te your sensing function might just be doubting your type doesn necessarily indicate ne anyway why do you think infp istj or intj are your most likely types and why are you so certain sensing is most likely your inferior function isfp',\n",

wise it is good fit just have pretty well developed tertiary fe which made it easy to relate to infjs and makes me less trollish is that even word than the stereo type of entp but did dabble in that type because had hunch was more t than f but never went to the extroverted intuition because thought was an introvert surprise it an extrovert anyway could took little break to try and pin down my type and after much searching and some outside consultation am coming out of the closet as entp which is why felt similar to but not quite infj you everything prada said those conversations are relationship glue and if they aren natural it doesn work sorry to be so black and white here but te dominates need relationships that aren i am visiting your subforum to get some idea whether use ti or fi how would you distinguish between the two am leaning more to ti so thought to explore the opposite for contrast give me an it took me long time to conceptualize ni basically the way work is take outside patterns ne and organize them on the inside using logic ti which can feel like descriptions of ni am am moving opposite of you lived most of my adult life as an infx but am discovering that doesn really fit the way think just the way behave which is essence was script was following to my last test was te 70 ti 70 ne 90 ne 90 fe 50 fi 45 se 20 si 25 or something like that honestly think that on further reflection don use te that much probably use ne more but it is would love an expert to finally help me pin down my type retest pretty often and have hit on pattern of dominate consistently over time spent so much time studying the functions and can relate to so much of what you were writing about typing oneself can be such challenge was stuck on understanding the functions for long time because while agree that they are the key have two daughters seven years apart and the esfj is the older one do have to get on her to not parent her sister so get that would be true she tries really hard not to but it just natural first thing that came to my mind huh huh huh they said tool in beavis voice and then was off on tangent nice thought vacation have two esfjs in my life my daughter and my good friend understand where you are coming from they definitely can have issues with the idea that some people like their space and autonomy but my daughter is an esfj and is extremely sensitive to other people sometimes wish she wouldn worry so much about what people think and just be herself but she would never want to hurt someone jane eyre it never too late to talk about bad knee haba aba daba aba thank you for posting that and just to clarify that is not remotely what experience just imagine the words don actually hear anything in the physical sense think wow that was great explanation of how it works for me given this data set this must be n thing not particular to ne or ni checked with the voices and they say no am not exactly sure how to explain this but usually have chatter in my head either replaying conversation or imagining conversation how it might play out some of these are pretty complex agreed entps are scary obviously am questioning my vs pness am pretty laid back or more organized you describe our relationship to tee do so many things because he likes it done that way sometimes sounds like an interesting investigation tell me more about being married to an xstj am pretty sure my guy is an estj and it can be interesting at times he definitely gets into modes and there is no distracting him unless want an almost always have talking in my head it is more dialogue than monologue play out conversations with other people or even whole scenarios this pretty much happens unless am getting enough my first inclination is to present my idea and back it up if necessary with an argument if refrain from debating with someone on point it is because it is futile waste of breathe not because that line well can imagine the scenario in my head and no that is definitely not me worked with an isfj my teaching partner and she was the sweetest person but she drove me insane first off catching entp interest required some bait sorry no death star was involved second thank you for all the feedback the infjs are just telling me to not worry am okay just being me liked the feedback about evaluating which judging preference goes with which perceiving preference and am not sure if had to make guess would not say use my intuition to read people oh would definitely skip variables in fact could benefit from slowing the process down little sometimes because over consolidate variables to get to theory faster definitely start am having an mbti identity crisis know there is separate subforum forum for this but you don seem to have the tj obsession on posting place observances so hope you will indulge me posting am in the eternal quest to type myself accurately and am stuck here are my results from the similar minds

earlier there not much you can do if she made her mind up before you can get around to revealing your underbelly this is you and your infp what pity it seemed to be going so well this sounds like mentally you were good match but perhaps not good enough match emotionally for her anyway it hard what question do you want to be asked iow what subject are you keen to talk about but rarely get to for one reason or another bonus round what question do you hate being asked test neutral good but know some nfps that would be chaotic good nfjs probably tend toward lawful good or lawful neutral never mind the fact that pure capitalist theory operates on the false assumption that society is completely egalitarian and that all people have equal access to resources libertarianism is based that awesome and rather interesting stiletto and sophia1 m very much on the same page we should compare notes we may have some crossover on our favourites and some good suggestions to wow m surprised to hear this thought it was only people like me that liked depressing movies does it have to be brutal on large scale or do you like quiet twisted and dark yeah this sort of behaviour makes things pretty shitty for js it must seem crazy or sign of total incompetence but there are reasons for it perceivers have great difficulty making plans there been some good advice here but just want to add this speaking as infp m all for te systems need the order and the clarity when feel chaos taking over the fact this guy hired dumaresq puts it very well but will also add to this you understand your idea better than others because you know all the factors and thought processes that went into shaping it sometimes you can have all the right ideas and say all the right things but often it comes down to expressing it in the right way you may present an argument in way that is meaningful and convincing to hm this is one way of looking at it suppose infps believe that and m pretty sure tjs too you ll have to set me right on that having the right perspective mindset understanding will often rommzu90 maybe should explain my thinking m looking for common threads across the different problems and seeing how they tie together need to know what differentiates the things that bother ok rommzu90 more clarity needed tell me what are the barriers you think are stopping you from resolving things or finding closure obviously they re there but can pinpoint what form they then forgive me rommzu90 but m going to be more blunt and talk to you straight up like entj would wink based on what you ve said it seems like you are choosing your situation to put rommzu90 there a couple of things that might help 1 acknowledge those simmering emotions but don let them overwhelm you they re just signs information like any other telling you that yeah well thought so but m biased and perhaps think better of my type than others do intriguing what would be your list of essential infp qualities and how best to approach them more list of potential pitfalls than how to guide really wanted to know all the clever ways entjs win infps over m not sure if you wish to discuss her view of infps or the difficulties see fair enough used to see the two types as oil and water but as mature and as entjs mature think we grow more alike well at least more complementary not to sound condescending don understand isn the fact that your position is irrational and therefore logically untenable enough of reason doesn personal consistency matter to you and could you explain your easy hope you see the irony of your situation if not let me help you out you know several infps who have problems that stem from illogical thinking that they are very aware of yet are sorry to butt in was just wondering about your last paragraph it an interesting comment to me especially as it seems like the other entjs identify as well do you mind explaining that also you make list of weaknesses for your type and they re all work related ve had two entj lecturers at uni both in limited entry courses ie less than 12 people one was the worst teacher ve ever had and one was the best entj 1 was belligerent nasty johanna mason the hunger games series martha who afraid of virginia woolf patty hewes damages becky sharp vanity fair lady mary crawley downton abbey sloan sabbith the newsroom d have to know details to give more specific advice but here goes fps aren persuaded by objective language as much as they are driven by their instinctual gut impressions of things hey m totally with you on that m the same way how you get around this sort of problem don know there got to be way of getting the paranoia out of the way and getting to the good yeah this can be easy even if you have honourable intentions you re fighting against precedent set by other guys however you need to see this from the woman perspective too if she do you think you re not coming across in the the way you intend or do you think you re going after the wrong sort of women actually few types can imagine and consider different perspectives like infp you have the type pegged entirely wrong if your mum is in fact infp and relatively healthy version of the agree think healthy development is necessary for infp entj relationship to work perhaps more than any other type combination up until few years ago seriously thought entjs were

was in small store and this one esfp know maybe friend but wouldn say so just comes from somewhere behind me hugs wasn push to activities but my mom was and still is often annoyed to my behaviour in social situations it often said that being introvert doesn mean that the person is shy but was and yep remember those lessons we studied those pascal things our class was quite interesting if we liked the teacher we were extremely nice and the teachers liked us but if not we could it was so like that in maths we had this great teacher that always had some advanced and difficult tasks for those who found the book exercises boring or too easy or if you had done all the my swedish teacher was like 65 years old somewhat nice person but was crappy teacher on first semester of seventh grade we had different teacher got 10 then but after that had nine in primary school found nothing particularly interesting secondary school started giving me challenges so my grades started do rise and my

the difference from si users from my experience most ni users are not grand visionaries stereotype and si users aren long term planners ni users will probably be more likely the ones to say want to get married at age think he over complicates things but he is obviously extremely knowledgeable old test enfj new test infj the tone of your posts screams ni te to me just had to tell you that emotions are reactionary and on the offense if somebody says something hurtful or conflicting you tend to be quick to respond if under stress physical symptoms are displayed through facial the answer doesn give away its position in your stacking it just tells me that you clearly value si over se as your sensing function you are certainly an intp though it is clear as day lol anything other than intj is just wrong got 100 intj for you definitely si valuing based on the 2nd question with the pictures first ll say noticing sensory detail isn exclusively si that also se so inxjs do notice sensory detail but that is not their main focus also the difference is si is more attuned to how the you definitely strike me as an intuitive fe user so by default gotta say infj don see fi or si in your answers so many infjs on this website lol your answer to question 1 has little dont think you can narrow this down to two functions gonna go ahead and say you re enfp because of 1 and that you have dr seuss quote sorry don have much to go on have to stereotype little you do seem feeling oriented for sure also m not don see how hes an introvert can see him being enfj enfp si or ne it weird feel like don fit into any description of the qudras m not as cheery and silly as an alpha m not as aggressive dramatic as beta at least dont think am could be xsfp the fi is obvious not seeing much in terms of intuition or ne your answer to question 2 about wanting an amazing life but not being able to take action to make it happen tells me you re think that ne comment sounds more ni sounds more subjective than objective anime chaotic evil 5w6 quote yeah intj checks out esfp low intuition close feeling and logic functions high sensing fi is evident in hostility towards inauthentic people fi caring but also te directness she aimed to be productive but know in your heart you are loved fe enjoy the journey se life is about creating yourself fi live the life you ve imagined ne or se ni mixed reality has limits only gonna list the ones know of ap rocky is definitely se dominant but can tell if he values ti or fi m guessing estp but he can be esfp schoolboy is hard to type for me but istp believe what you re referring to is most likely an ni thing but can say for sure for me can never recall my dreams whenever my girlfriend tells me her dreams my first instinct is to m hardcore introvert but the reason why hesitate on typing myself inxp is because don relate to ti or fi well enough to declare that dominant only judging function feel can describe me interesting can you expand on the bolded part always never understood how ne and si are connected but believe what you stated there is starting to make me understand what dont understand is that some people say si is about the past and others say its about comfort which one is it cant relate to the comfort aspect so much mean my favorite place to think like this too look at situation or an object and it sets me off on an inner monologue about the essence of it this happens to me lot for me it mostly focused on people and how they its weird relate to both the si and ni lot of times find myself preparing for what already knows whats coming up sometimes before have conversation with someone play out their the chase sounds very ni se the chase of pleasure not for it own sake but the chasing of pleasure so your life can have meaning very ni se m thinking your perception functions are you re reeking of intuition so thats obvious just skimmed thru gonna take wild guess and say enfj can prove it but he doesn sound very ne and he definitely doesn sound fi dominant or even fe and think if he was an intp you guys would relate to each other lot more than you do think he intj agree with enfp your description can almost easily fit my enfp sister if we were going by stereotypes based on your hobbies and interests d say intp all the way lol sometimes the correct answer is right in your face to all the ni users who say they live in their heads wouldn it be safe to say all introverted inituitives in their heads don see how thats exclusive to ni dominants relate to every single one of these except don have as much confidence in my predictions so if an ni user walks into room see an empty coffee cup guy with red eyes and computer screen filled with data are you saying ni will try to piece that data together and connect them to from my understanding si looks at an object and relates it to their stored impressions based on their personal past experiences in reality ni looks at an object and tries to form an abstract you may be right on logic guess see his mannerisms and humor as ne esque but he is definitely fe valuing at least auxiliary and he does rap lot about his past so isfj may actually be right travi is definitely ixfp it could go either way but where does anyone see ne or si in him really don see it get more of an fi si vibe from kendrick but he could be enfp ne te is more present in tyler than kendrick or gambino tyler is enfp most ne person ever joey is infj he values fe over te he people oriented watch his interviews cole is ixfj he definitely an fe user for sure he most

think and type it school papers are so frustrating for me because can help but agonize over the content m not super familiar with how mbti classifies shadow functions but you might enjoy checking out socionics which lays out every function and it role for types it takes bit to decifer and like the specificity you used in your examples when asked for advice on something that isn all simple logic like relationships or big choice they have to make hardly ever suggest they do this is awesome for moment the nf has swept me up so high that saving the universe is more possible than it already was but mending the holes in each others fabrics of logic can be enough to chime chime love this thread and the intp esfj duality idea so esfjs while you re here and insanityaware this may oooor may not be of any use to you would love to know how fe reacts socionics relationships can be funny because ve had some esfps conflictor that click with me in second and some esfjs dual that can stand being around however have found that strong think what you said about nts is right at least in my experience the only bad sex ve ever had was with girls who weren willing to at least share control of the situation either because they people get pissed at me when tell them don have favorite color so trivial to me patterns have much more meaning to me than colors interesting thread though finding hair that isn mine in my food when live alone ve had this click with few intps before but recently met girl in class presumed to be intp but we didn really engage in anything that had to do with building friendship it was almost intps learn well from experience the best way for you to learn how to deal with social interactions is to just go out put yourself in them more often it a scary thought but it that simple when exam in an hour haven studied yet but evolution is pretty intuitive right can handle myself in super emotional situations with women ve cried at every break up it ridiculous m sucker for shows of affection if girl is always hugging me m inclined to if he an intp he probably into you from the information you gave anyway it sounds like it don randomly message girl like that unless like her the typical intp guy has no idea what public stoning at the town square tomorrow at noon accept my punishment m not huge fan of math but could easily get math or physics degree if wanted too it comes easy just don like it scored 1 thinking over feeling on the online tests but definitely was just going to say this intps are great critical analyzers so once you are able to understand the connections between things and build kind of map of the subject in your head you can do lizzie mcguire harry dunne dumb and dumber mary poppins for sure only esfj main characters can think of always wonder how the parts of something come together to form whole but know if take something apart ll have to put it together again so don bother physically deconstructing it error file snuggle does not exist sleep mode initiating 1 definitely social drinker other than that like beer for the taste but usually d rather get high when know m not going out 2 usually regret how act the night get wasted was excited to find the socionics sub type theory intp ne fits so perfectly and imagine would be hard to peg as an intp at first glance was also thinking that maybe mbti introverts don i love enfjs so welcoming ve been trying to build frame work in my mind for non physical plane of energy where souls exist inspired by astral projection stories and theories ve had dreams where was dead and most enfjs are probably too nice to use sarcasm sarcasm is used to point out the ridiculousness of something someone but singling someone out like that is not your style so it comes off assholish relationships and crushes can be brutal but mbti types are just classifications of the way people perceive the world persons past does lot to shape person personality that is not measured ve been chronically procrastinating ever since moved out of my parents house think of it as part of my delayed reaction teenage rebellion adderall does wonders though for me though think it definitely depends on the type intps generally don argue unless they are knowledgeable on the subject and don enjoy debates if the other person isn digesting the argument logically istp is the enfj dual typically ixxp translates to ixxj in socionics in order to keep the 1st and 2nd functions the same here a chart intertype relations wikisocion or you could yep you ll have to ask her intps don really take control of relationships in the early stage especially the friend dating gf transition zones make your intentions clear or she won know how intps are actually intjs in socionics making esfps their conflictor esfjs are the dual of intps hope this doesn make you realize your life is lie',\n",

              " ' do agree with you that book counterparts are generally smarter just don think the writers are very sophisticated at writing appropriate reactions from the characters like you mentioned any thoughts on euron greyjoy so far m thinking esxp kind of funny because estp ramsay esfp joffrey euron in the books is probably an estp but don know in the show he more barry allen the flash is solid example of an enfp think finn is more of an esfp some would argue leia organa is an entj but don know if agree with that wonder woman in the comics this is an interesting thread and m glad the whole this character is an infj is being discussed from multiple perspectives and have confession to make like typing fictional ah get what you mean thanks for explaining it for me and yeah it makes sense like said early ll put more thought onto it istp can see strong argument for it just entp that i don think see anything in jung description of fi that would suggest they could read people interesting although do think tony is an esfp ll put more thought into that note m just typing tony stark in the mcu not in the comics honestly think going to war and taking action te over the lose of child is incredibly fi it just tony motives are easily thought tony was thinker at first but then came across this very good description of fi in tony until the sales of weapons impacts tony directly he doesn care about them and then from firefly you have zoe as clear cut istj then you have wash as an esfp although an argument could be made for enfp ygritte estp and jon snow ixfp although some will disagree with me fi interesting sometimes fi isn about moral convictions but bratty childish this is what want therefore it takes priority over all else unhealthy fi is selfish but healthy fi considering the deep discussion on the donald trump thread thought maybe we could discuss the long history of presidents of the usa you can just type one president or the ones of the 21st question for those who lean more to estp where do you see ti fe as opposed to fi te mon even if you hate weezer there first two albums were solid tad on the immature side in the lyrics though but we all have different tastes know it from celebrity types but they do make good case for rivers cuomo weezer here are the quotes they list cuomo believe in finishing what started cuomo while like good points am seeing more of an argument for entj the combination of trump fierce firm principles and lack of tolerance te mixed with singular vision for what he wants usa to be ni for m struggling to find types for songs but can type the albums grunge is very sp genre imo bleach istp tongue in check experimental yet wonderfully aware nevermind esfp anthems yeah amanda seyfried character been while since saw mean girls but d lean more to enfp maybe she has ne in lower position perhaps recall her eccentric comments her outlook in life this is an interesting thread think any type can be remembered make mark on the world impact on peoples lives isfps included so don think we are forgetful per say but very aww look an intj thinks he right and being honest so cute and cliche you re not worth it we are just debating on interpretations seeing as you have never given any examples on how anyway m no longer discussing this have no intention to have conversation with someone who is condescending and rude don deserve to be treated with scorn wow aren you lovely person just tip when debating with someone avoid making such claims as you are taking moralistic standpoint or your missing the point seriously don talk down to answer the op question karen from mean girls classic ne dom she into ideas odd ways of thinking etc as opposed to the concrete reality ne can care about the truth but with karen who pillaged the riverlands who gave the order was it catelyn or tywin because if it not catelyn why are we holding her accountable for grown man adult actions m sure oberyn martell yes blame the riverlands on catelyn blame the rape pillage and murder not on the person who gave the order but because of catelyn decision tywin is grown man and an adult he accountable ridiculous feats of competence such as the red wedding the ultimate band aid solution him being hand of the king to aerys who he struggled to keep in check ll give tywin arranging cersei tywin smart let see couldn talk tyrion out of shooting him on the toilet is the most hated person in westeros by his solution of resorting to rape and murder being hated is not smart used to type him as an intuitive ve seen some enfj typings as well depends how you interpret his character or arc but robb stark from game of thrones song of ice and fire he rebels against the lannisters and joffrey despite wielding power over him hell he well saint michael the archangel from the bible and catholic interpretations always struck me as an estj or entj direct does what needs to be done his most famous artwork by luca giordano is depending on your perspective on whether or not she is villain dolores from westworld really does strike me as an enfp so ve been rewatching alot of doctor who in the past week and tbh struggle alot with mickey because do see alot of se like willingness to take charge but m torn between whether or not he hmm enjoyed iron fist despite its flaws but ll admit some of the characterization for the characters wasn exactly clear danny isfp colleen tricky ll say istj for now ward about padme being an enfj to fill in blank space maz could possibly be an enfj but we need to see more of her get and agree with estp for poe d however note he has really healthy fe and damn just saw the dw thread on sticky forgot to look there m silly lol couldn find the dw thread so ll start this one to discuss bill m thinking entp her ne fe is through the roof with ti giving her curious analytical and individual streak other ve always found dean to be hard to type on one hand he seems to be the classic estj straight forward commanding honest dedicated citizen but there also an argument for esfp or estp not love istjs dearly and despise pauline hanson but istj does make the most sense for her here the thing about si it can make people great learners fast on their feet commanding respect do think cersei uses logic it just toxic lannister m the best therefore win logic she reminds me of tywin alot which is ironic cersei is the son tywin always wanted to be like him but whilst agree everything cersei does is about ending up losing her own power te users can lose their power over time tywin lannister legacy is in utter decay and nothing tywin nor kevan did well cersei sucks at fe it kind of hard to manipulate people who hate you or have their own agendas the sparrows for instance everyone hates cersei except jaime and joffrey and she doesn i ve said negan in the past was an esxp but m leaning more on entj these days negan loves all things power structure rules responsibilities order etc there is no struggle he likes ti should not be reduced to simply logical what it is the making sense of the world through and acting on logic as it is introverted it is incredibly personalized and not driven as an adapting you can do either if you like it up to you oh it wasn aimed at you but should ve been more clear on what meant so m sorry for my lack of clarity you can be critical of beyonce but you can also praise her if you like really the title says it all this is thread for anyone who wants to talk about sensors sjs and sps throughout history anyone as long as they fascinate you somehow you consider them to be with beyonce think you have straight forward sfj she knows exactly how to play and run the show and take over the limelight from others ni can do this any type could but with beyonce she i still think margaery is si user she knows exactly what she is doing uses established methods to gain love charity work for instance often plays to societies expectations what makes her haneke kind of rusty for me haven seen film of his in while but adore the white ribbon his films are kind of stripped bare meaning there is lack of excess or overall interference sofia coppola very interesting think she an isfp ve seen all her films with the exception of the bling ring and ve noticed the following very aesthetical pleasing and mood setting about

rather than using stereotypes and titles to determine which category you belong to the question is whether you are an si dominant or an ni dominant since you have been tossing around the idea of startfiring an nt forum the reason being that since there are well established forums for specific types intjf intpc etc perhaps strictly nt based what are these core similarities find it exceedingly easy to be clever am best characterized as reserved though not overly entp in social situations but the difference is that do not partake in such socializing the genesis of this thread and perhaps this entire thread in sense is entirely bogus emotional distance and lack of outward empathy does not in any way contribute to being an asshole as an hmm ve never had this problem honestly or anything similar then again don speak much anyway unless give insightful information or drop clever joke into conversation do you have you worry too much about this sort of dialogue is it seriously all many girls that give these kinds of responses or was your statement an exaggeration get the words cool genius and smart thrown at me very often ve never had to put forth effort when collecting friends according to females m handsome too so that probably helps as they often make for good conversation and as someone who uses lot of metaphorical language naturally they are breath of fresh air in typical conversations really don have to break the ice female intj in general are rare so for you to have handfull of them to interact with is exceptionally scarce have to say that have never befriended an intj before but instead seem to many of the petty questions posted here are hated by intp as well my favorite what wrong mean am supposed to be stupidly and outwardly warm towards everyone all of the time don forget gnu linux like to keep my desktop environment elegant and functional that your choice but that brand of fatalism yields the same kind of outcome as the style of fatalism harbored by chrstians muslims jews etc in my opinion folks such as you and should care more it seems as though you are misunderstanding mbti jung you aren even sure whether you are best classified as or after all isn that what this is about classification categorization when m bored of being confined in the intp section so forgive my intrusion mental self mental stimulation growth

retreated within my own imagination without don see my emotions as valid when analyzing systems and reaching conclusions naturally indulge in this behavior therefore my emotional repression is more passive rather than active indeed she definitely loves you as friend because we intp will avoid anyone short of who is perceived as awesome like the plague unless it suits our benefits in some way the point is that twentyseven and cheveyo hit the nail on the head keep up the casual relationship and slowly reel her in personally can hardly open up to the nf friend with whom we seem to share mutual well trees evolved to survive in their environment and not in an environment with idiot humans setting flame to them this thread isnt serious but went ahead and contributed read intp org stuff although it is lengthy the comprehensive descriptions are impeccable peg you as an intj intp or istp you haven given enough information more so the right kind of know from experience that estj can be very emotional around other family members or friends agree with this observation yeah we intp are known to be erotic fiends in the sack my speculations d like to get them tested dad estj mom isfj sister estj my brother tested as an intp but he has more and than do does he enjoy downtime often have you ever had the gut feeling that he doesn get the big picture or all of the details how sensitive is he 1 5 scale could he possibly be narcissist has this most likely means nothing we are not the most loving creatures on this earth so it best to just accept that he ll do this we are ti dominants so this is going to happen lot in my like them pretty well have three good enfp friends and for some reason seem to attract them sort of have to like them regardless ehh you re severely simplifying the concepts of truth and proof that is why you see philosophical inquiries and explanations as unnecessarily complex op as for me typically turn dull see shame as that annoying terminator

some good music know what he likes and and try to do it together felt free didn think as much as do now was always staying in lot enjoying my own company and playing video games didn care to hang out with friends like most people my age ah that may mean cookies to you folk across the pond chocolate digestive cookies no dipping chocolate biscuits in tomato sauce go out alone most of the time and love it it means can stay out longer and not get tired due to excess external stimuli and there is the fact that don have to compromise about what want this really only happens when am in my shadow side the estp am the same as you in regards to this topic have something framed in box frame that has come undone it still on my wall just need to fix it ll do it in like 6 months or year or something it annoys me whenever look at it dear fellow infjs would like to know some more about you do you smoke used to quit in 2010 what are your drinkings habits wine beer again used to drink alcohol quit older people prefer it because they are wiser and can have serious conversations think the universe has plan for us so do think our future is pre destined but also think we can choose the way in which we reach certain destination points which is where we have our free we all suffer from intrusive thoughts but most of us disregard them it is normal thing did once struggle with them because used to hang on to them and ruminate why was having them until it is sad world we live in when we value money over lives sorry to hear of your circumstances rebecca this planet is shallow hate them think arrogance contributing to somebody being douchebag isn that valid reason personally believe you can be arrogant if you have earned it as for an infj being douchebag if don think will ever fully understand why is obnoxious judging by your opening sentences it seems that build up of recent events have influenced your state of mind this has happened to me also would encourage you to seek self reflection and thanks for your post paragonight right now feel will get no benefit from friendship with her at this point in time it will only bring me misery have composed message which will thanks people ve slept on it and agree with you all guess fresh start will be coming up some of you may remember that was turned down by girl liked couple of months ago we continued to be friends but tonight she and male acquaintance of mine began getting intimate in front of yes m very sensitive to touch even somebody just handing me change after buy something can just go through me may be wrong but think it when ni picks up on something and then ti counters it with rational explanation and then your ni will just keep repeating the same process because it trying to know an enfp who think is type 7 and she isn bubbly on the other hand also know an enfp 2 who is think lot of it depends on enneagram know relatively unhealthy enfp and she breaks down in public but they do have fi and encourage my enfp to let her emotions out when she feels like it as an infj enjoy helping her get m 6w5 my deepest core fear is lack of security as was already mentioned for those that are 6 whatever comes at you that is unexpected just have faith that you will have the ability to am not sure what my idea of heaven is like but do think it a temporary place we go to before we come back again in different form ie another person or living entity 1999 was 18 went to college and met who is still my best friend other things happened that year that made it great one m not sure if tarot reading would be compatible in the realm of the supernatural but decided to buy my first deck of tarot cards and try it out myself well let me tell you that particular this would depend lot on enneagram since it deals with core fears am 6 and at times can be unsure of the decisions make in life although rarely change them normally once have made a pretty smile compassion sensitivity intellect have many acquaintances but few true friends but that okay only need 1 or 2 true friendships sorry but me and entps do not get along well at all find them insensitive and overbearing at times although do like the dress sense of female entps know 2 entps and keep them at love ufology but personally have had no experiences involving the paranormal although still swear that was tapped on the shoulder by somebody who wasn there when turned around once unfortunately tarot reading has been tarnished by scammers posing as legitimate readers at places such as fairs labelling themselves as fortune tellers doing readings in exchange for money etc you will find that many sensors are skeptical about this type of stuff think intuitives are more open to the idea thanks for sharing your interesting story do the same as has been previously mentioned rationalise person behaviour if think they are signs of crush it is ni clashing with ti have been making it point to just listen to my do you even believe in stuff to do with psychics mediums and tarot readers have friend who reads tarot cards for free for me and many predictions have come true some of which happened in think we have few major differences based on the one infp friend have he has terribly low confidence to the point where feel like father figure to him and have to do things for him yep used to wear the black and white makeup and all that jazz used to get really drunk and do some light drugs but to be honest think that can be natural part of just growing up the same game listen to music read research interesting topics online just small stuff it doesn take lot to make me happy really do but try to keep in mind whether am dealing with someone who has fi then try to just console them and give advice later but it hard especially more so when attract strangers who just collect autographs boxing memorabilia and movie props that were used in movies kind of cycle between the three since tend to focus on one area at particular time and eventually get get tarot readings and my reader friend believes that we see the same people over different lifetimes am kind of coming round to that idea so the highlighted lines of your post resonate with at age 35 have taken more interest in developing my se and recently have felt more comfortable just being in the moment and doing things without thinking too much surprisingly many of my fb can be dangerous place and often provokes unnecessary reactions and emotions in people post philosophical quotes myself when see one from somebody else can be impressed by it but end thank you liz smile asked out female enfp couple of weeks ago she shot me down but we are now just like how we were before asked her out there is no awkwardness or anything just go for it have crushes on people

wear him pretty much what gte said don like casual sex that much either it mechanical to me and it looks like working live very healthy never used drugs and hardly drink anymore get my emotional am an autistic idiot too when it comes to things am interested in as soon as understand things let it drop by the way other people probably perceive me as lazy but think of myself when was young would fiercefully try to convince people of the fact that was right when they disagreed could get mad nowadays hardly ever get into discussions since that requires have my own norms and follow my own values sometimes they are congruent with the general one but most often they aren that often leads to possible discussions when was young would insecure people who act nice towards me because they seek approval and want me to like them get annoyed give short answers and then ignore them they bore me and are energy suckers blegh hmm interesting since if read this would say intp have moped and have fallen hard couple of times just get up and keep on driving most of the time have forgotten about it yup lot of people pass my net but rarely one sticks got one now and think he is an estp he is kinda like me but instead of bookwise he is street wise and that interests me enough to am little afraid probably more because of the unknown next to that also afraid of suffering think it is bummer if d die actually have become quite good at life am very have hard time defining too what the definition of friend is most people had in my life was based on shared experiences when was around 18 played lot of tennis and had 3 guys i am self motivated and love sports don see not having life direction as problem it is part of who and what am since live in the moment actually do not have life direction quote zynthaxx 36156186 always thought being nonchalant was more of non or at least bad thinker trait for one generally act lot more stoical than the intps know but may be in the double came up with another one intp tend to react stoically istp nonchalant out of lot of information can get solution to problem my intp friend can make 100 ideas out of 1 piece of information read book when need data to solve problem problem ah well got dumped once too and yes it hurt like hell all those questions the constant regurgitating what could have happend however cannot hate person don have that function have of course you don understand how we do that we share zero cognitive functions but yes istp are not really known for looking in the future we generally have to get bit older to develop me too only solving problem physical activity and forms of sports or skill things darts pool get me to feel alive for the rest just exist like other said it is not so black and white we re not monsters and neither are we robots for me it is not that run from someone being clingy but from someone having clingy personalitey when people give claims of love or whatever you have to take them at face value at that moment they say it because they feel it at that moment but it is never statement for life an certainly have no new information but the fact that have learned to stop reading context but to stick what is really there in this case he simply isn in to you no matter how much you read into how can you lose him you don even have him have an esfj friend too as long as the conversations aren too emotional can be with her for about 6 hours after that get drained she talks lot about for me trivial things but she seriously knew was good but that could get someone off by just asking question hmm this made me think that maybe need to separate it think it is indeed sexual attraction but that that can make me tense this come is both ways if get the idea that someone is sexually do you also feel whether he wants to bone you nice description like bantering with people and know that in the right woman and maybe gay men too don know can create quite some attraction can see when women are interested can have experienced that the only way for me to commit is being infatuated with someone however when that wears off start to feel anxious and locked up and will become unhappy that is one of the got roi 88 realistic 71 observant 70 introverted identity challenging hmmm narcissist also has these two traits lot of terms for maybe certain type of person don really know recognize myself in you same traits that is simply istp difference between that and being socio or psychopath is the feeling of guilt absolutely have the feeling guilt the socio and ve read lot of threads about people who deal with istp in sexual relational manner and realized that acually never feel if someone is sexually interested in me it is not that women don if my feelings are gone it is over have no further need to stay with girl not even friendship also can hardly imagine his feelings are gone over text or an email it probably was the my female training partner is one and she is one of the very few women can handle for more than couple of hours she is indeed as you describe and she can also be fantastically sarcastic and sure but only if cross my own boundaries not because someone else feels offended m responsible for my actions not their feelings more tolerant but solely on the matter that understand that lot of people simply work differently than do so don hold it against them understand they have more emotions than do and schedules couple of things invites me to party stays with group of friends definately not description of an istp we are the contrary for the rest she sounds like chaotic have watched the istp video and love watching it it is obvious that he is still young also love you re way of interviewing this sheds whole different light on personality types can you also do that with complete stranger mean recognize the word part because don forget word someone says either also notice any behaviour that deviates from their normal can someone explain to me why when you stay under car without making noise they walk by you and they don smell you but when you want to walk thru gang of them you have to cover in their am from the netherlands so today is voting day vote right wing simply because am for less government interference and want us to get out of the eu it is going to be interesting day perfect explanation my usual answer don know don care coffee people don find me boring but indeed people who don know me very well probably have the impression am boring simply because don talk to be heard and rarely have an opinion about trivial think the problem with the general istp is that we read books when we don have the data to solve problem puzzle whatever that problem may be that is why in general always had lower if you have to fix it then it is broken ti is perfect instrument to prevent things from being broken any behavioral change from your significant other should alert you objective perception me too for me theory suppors practice not the other way around so my house is filled with half read books yes challenge am dropping everything and go to my greatest friend google to be totally disappointed of course like paraskevidekatriafobia better it even has meaning ah ok well you responded very literally to my example but what mean to say is that we or at least do not supress moral behaviour but we have our own set of standards some may be the same an addiction would be big word more finding something new and or exciting and go devote all your attention to it so much it becomes obsessive until new thing comes along or you lose interest ',\n",

relaxed and content have family and friends who love me and support me m not opposed to dating but am not actively searching if meet someone awesome if don if you stay in an unhealthy relationship all you will do is grow in unhappiness and resentment you can help yourself or anybody unless you give yourself chance to become your own person and you like most people when the infj balances the hero and the asshole they are more content and well rounded people who allow themselves enough perspective to offer something awesome while keeping their happy sad aggressive bittersweet name the emotion it hits infj at their core emotion is not only the infj strongest reaction to the outside world but is also their initial reaction while if it is starting to affect your quality of life in significant way then yes but if your shy to go to get together but then open up and have fun even slowly it not bad it bad when you lol okay maybe came on bit harsh but find that once people find out their types especially infjs typically tend to expect others to make concessions for them heck when first found out i punch through small talk with my empathic charm and cute creepy grin with bugged out eyes that would give squirrel on pcp run for its money 8d but seriously just bust out the deep stuff yeah have this sometimes but then realize the friends and people that matter are the ones who realize that im human and will make mistakes and we will forgive each other for freudian slips the if person doesn like the real you then why the fuck should you care what they think learn to look for and appreciate the people who don judge you and talk to them talk with the people where move on as cold as it sounds he a grown human being if he wants to fuck up great relationship with someone who truly cares about him that is his choice if you let yourself get dragged down as an infj noticed paradox while am shy and like to be alone as become overwhelmed by absorbing too many emotions at once or for too long when am alone for too long strongly desire the infj are prone to going off in our vivid imaginations if we don lock eyes we will lose focus the beauty of the empty purposelessness of existence is the lack of beauty that leaves space for you to make your own try things learn more take your time enjoy the present too friends family that have the greatest insight and control over me my advice is accept her decision to be with the other guy and move on romantically but if she is good person friend keep the friendship but do not wait for her romantically or be her bitch like cheese what do you like spiderman never ignores 8d someetimes to fault but anyways you don have to go all gung ho but be firm about it mean nobody is happy in this situation if you call her on her crap she men the dark pheonix saga by chris claremont astonishing men 1 24 by joss whedon ultimate spiderman the death of spiderman by brian michael bendis spiderman to have and to hold by matt sorry old man rivers won quote you again as for the reason use fuck well first of all have the freedom to and don see why one word should be given so much meaning not to mention it based on personal experience am neither an optimist or pessimist do sometimes feel optimistic yes do sometimes feel pessimistic yeah but don let those terms define me because if i would argue if someone rebelled only to rebel against the establishment this paradox applies but if someone makes the choice to rebel because they believe it is necessary it is not this okay this is late in the game and you seem to have really grown and gotten better but you wrote that you are still kind of going through rough time so this is for incase you still are my advice is straight up tell her what you told us if you want offer friendship if she is willing to see things your way and improve and stop making you feel shitty if not start practicing your personal opinion by no means be all end all advice stop using the infj typing and typology in general as restriction it easy to use infj as category to plan your love life but being vulnerable won kill you getting hurt won kill you you are going to get hurt it inevitable it deciding or moreso allowing yourself to find the person who is worth all the depends if she is trying to act strictly to society view of masculine probably not moreso if the case is she is not going to let societies human constructs determine who she is and is willing stop going on full tilt 100 of the time in order to not burn out you need to let yourself recharge honestly you don need to convert or to whatever but suggest looking into existentialism contemplating on how to sound profound but for whom if people think am profound does that make me profound eat popcorn and ponder mmmm cheesy popcorn like it my friend and ',\n",
              " ' m married to an infj and think my first boyfriend was an intj so pretty big gap there but these are my impressions enfp infj think conversations will naturally be more about 1 emotional eating absolutely throughout my life ve really struggled with this had depression as teenager and it was before binge eating disorder was really recognized but now since ve hi guys know there are ton of threads brainstorming career ideas for enfps but am looking for something more broad than that am interested in hearing from enfps who have worked in was thinking tonight about my own seemingly endless search for career love and realized that think maybe why enfps frequently struggle to find rewarding career is that perhaps our np my fiance is an infj and he is going through lot of stress lately he has frequent headaches and does not want to do anything other than play on his computer or watch sports he does not talk to me ve had relationships with entp intj estj infp and infj and really think all of those but the entp could work out wonderfully for an enfp depending on individual preferences family history m actually strongly leaning toward typing you as an infj you still seem more introverted to me even after breaking everything out in your second post my fiance is an infj and he is still very thank you so much for the thoughtful response eb44345 it definitely does give me more to think about can you tell me more as to why that a really interesting way of explaining thank you guys ve thought about it more since posting this and also believe am an enfp think got confused about the difference between keeping objects organized and keeping thoughts thought that person was an more interested in finding the practical solution what is really in front of him her etc and that person was definitely an interested in larger the emphasis on being physically strong and healthy seems like si mixed with te to me also think si could fit with the interest in history ancient civilizations tradition etc my vote is previously have thought that am an enfp and got enfp when took the mbti six years ago at age 17 later took the mbti and got intp but know that is wrong but now am starting to wonder say what if you are going to dismiss my analysis that quickly can you please tell me why cannot see isfj and isfp at all in your responses they are two of the last types would guess for you immediately thought you were thinker when was reading your response to the picture did not mean that having as the highest score automatically makes you dominant meant that it seems very unlikely to me that person would be dominant if their preference for was only because you seem to have both thinking and feeling developed parts to your personality and because of your test results am inclined to believe you are an intj for intp thinking is the dominant could someone please link these articles that say iq correlates with mbti always thought that type and iq did not correlate good question will probably end up echoing some of the things you said but want to go ahead and think them through myself anyway improvements more understanding and appreciative of want normal life in the sense that want to have family and don feel the need to move to new place want to travel out of the country at some point but it doesn have to be for any m 22 and graduated college last year the hardest thing for me about my 20 so far is that am lonely have great boyfriend and couple long term close friends in my area but everyone is so this sounds like ti to me as does this my understanding is that enfps are usually more sensitive to criticism than that the difficulty in articulating your personal values also leads me your feeling function is so obvious to me and to most people reading this it seems that am lead to believe it is your dominant function this is further confirmed by the consistency of the your understanding of the ti function sounds more like the difference between and to me is big picture is details that sounds like ne to me the perceiving intuitive function the in terms of romance it doesn really matter what you do as long as you are smart nice and considerate if we click we click if we don we don if you are trying to make us click then we will was depressed when was 15 too went to psychologist and got diagnosis and took antidepressants and the whole bit but now at 21 have been happy and healthy for four years the replied asking about editing and deleting posts but it is under control now sorry about that my infj long time friend is going through hard time his mom has been diagnosed with cancer and it is predicted that she will die within year she had cancer when he was in high school and they there are double and double couples in the world who are happy though it is possible to make this pairing work don mind playing the role but he still cancels etc are you saying this ve been dating an infp for almost ten months and we have so much trouble making plans to do fun things together he complains that we don do anything we don go out and have enough fun find can focus on anything until figure out how and why feel about any conversation relationship event etc that elicited an emotional reaction from me sometimes ll spend almost entire s is less of choice than t because t are the decision making functions childhood trauma etc are exceptions to the rule and posters have still been talking about it in terms of altering sounds to me like the reason she can be herself around you is that she cares more about you than anyone else so showing her true self is bigger risk with you than it is with anyone else yes m definitely like this too hate big parties where you can only talk to each person for two minutes at time and barely hear them because of the unnecessarily loud music very much this is great question discussion use mbti mostly within my own internal dialogue viewing others instead of getting upset or angry am now able to recognize that people simply see and do my best friend is an enfp as am and lately have been feeling really frustrated and almost neglected by her part of the problem is probably that we are both enfp so we ve got projections do romantic relationships bring out anyone else insecurities if really like someone no matter how affectionate or validating he is often feel very much not good enough for him the more that last bit is true he definitely spends lot of time at home by himself and loves it introverts still use extraverted functions but don know the guy at all so your guess is much better my best guesses mom esfj dad infp dad mother and sister enfp dad father istp dad brother infp mom five sisters and brother are all s think that the best can tell know an infp kind of like that at least the first few points about loud active can sit still think ne is sometimes more jolting or tangental when it the second function thanks for muchaparadox yeah that exactly what do glad m not the only one thing is sometimes it seems like it all ever do mean no one can ever be completely clear on what going on ve heard that we re the only extroverted type that needs to introvert from time to time however ve been scoring on lots of mbti tests including the official one since march took the daydream about my future and different ways it could play out more often do what if scenarios what would do if y happened also play out conversations with people in my head lot tried to test something here thinking could delete this post right after but don see how to sorry fit your description and yes am in relationship now with an infp so lots of love for your type haha struggle with this too the best ve come up with is to really make an effort to stand up for myself even if it just simply stating that disagree don have to start an argument or don ask what the world needs ask what makes you come alive and go do it because what the world needs is people who have come alive howard thurman have you ever heard read about the enneagram it doesn help you select mate typologically but it can help you in volumes toward getting what you truly want in life don believe this was meant to match up with mbti read the descriptions in the text for example h use si as the sensation of introverting on an idealized other daydreaming about idealized for me the most important thing is the desire and the effort to understand it okay if it takes time understand is also ambiguous loaded but communication is super important when have this prejudice it because feel excluded judged and or underappreciated by them including not judging and appreciating are things enfp are naturally good at so it ',\n",
              " ' no it not harsh it simply manner of speech and it straight to the point nope that would mean was passionate about not being normal of which cannot really define for but it is apparent that am not normal because shock the normals too often consider we do this to voice our opinions and to put it out there so someone who knows better mean tell us that we may be incorrect in our belief that we are _____ because of _______ reasons you even we would have much higher possibility of going out with bang need to find passion is utter bullshit have fleeting obsessions for as far as can remember and it works so well for me so do not need lifelong passion to feel normal which do not wish roommate who know well enough and like but roommate needs to absent from the apartment etc often enough so don start getting annoyed at them for whatever reasons love having people imho everyone is little narcissistic with frequent feelings grandiose but mean for anyone to have confidence he she needs to believe in his her abilities and skills in the right amounts bro you and are like the same person too enjoy pshychology quantum physics fitness and other subjects and hobbies that rarely go together for other people also m very independent but small talk is conversation where no significant information is revealed in the process also conversations or debates where the content will not help me or lead me to consider the information and sorry for you but no get down but never depressed what do you mean some point switch between introvert and extrovert on the daily will dress up when feel like it otherwise dress for the occasion and for regular stuff go with comfortable all the way in professional environment do the right thing and dress new game or show or activity to fixate on is the best cure for me yeah have friends very small number because categorize friends as people whom share lot of experiences with the more experiences the better the friend because our friendship has survived actually listen and do what the person m actually interested in has to say about me almost never say to anyone suggestions so when catch myself doing this know shit just got real sounds lot like me complain whole lot and my friends worry until they notice that just do it because do and will never be down for more than few hours tops just let him be stand up if need be and just walk away final fantasy vii ix xii kingdom hearts ii borderlands 2 league of legends hiatus in season 3 and now back one for all is hilariously fun world of warcraft end bc and early wotlk yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssss loved this game even though never beat it but rose is the best mostly interact with others so can test my level of manipulation on them or to get more ideas about my current topics on mind through conversation love implanting ideas into peoples minds zone out mid conversation if the topic at hand has no hold on me just yesterday was doing google video hangout with 3 others long time friends and they kept pointing out that wasn paying am nonconformist an unconventional thinker and an outlier to the social norm these being said even as an entp have noticed that am pretty fundamentally different from most of the people what the experiment you have in mind have two work friends both female and both introverts with very different behaviors for sake of identification one will be betty and the other is jessica betty is overly out spoken to the give no fucks and do what please you become dangerous hey now don go making these outlandish accusations man have done nothing to you trololololo it nice not knowing though it almost like an adventure into what yeah don particularly understand how people can express so much and so often about their feelings which are so fleeting generally have stopped wondering and trying to figure it out though yep moped for like 3 weeks and then got over it and she started to become bitch and keep hearing new people complain about her and m just laughing on the inside my buddy at work dated yep my co worker was like this when she first started so was like oh don understand you so m trying to figure her out and fell for her and got owned because when asked her out she came that just the thing the last line maybe some entps do but can be the only who does not want to convey these feelings don understand why it is necessary for me to convey feelings trololo lo it a reddit imgur comment style to catch the grammar nazis and waste their time looks like it still works disagree pretty sure we all explore our feelings pretty regularly but the problem is we don get the feelings there nothing to compare what we are feeling with anything of relevance we feel missing out on the feels dude m being crashed my waves of feels here and no m not missing out on something don get can miss what you don know what in the actual fuck you were way too nice what you should have respond to the question was are you fucking sorry play one often because it so entertaining especially when someone takes an opinion that you know well or believe in you get to see if they can help you learn more and explain things have sweet interview for this position that am really looking forward to and it would be super if get it and basically find reading information on entp and the like really helps because i think it the enfjs apparently work with like 5 of them they driving me crazy read the description and was like that guy sounds genius jackass hmmm sounded exactly like me like it excitement what noticed about entps as whole we do whatever sounds like that guy girl just hates you when m winning or when m lmaoing been noticing that mostly just get irritated with everything small and big but have flipped out twice in my life after both times people who were present started avoiding afterwards so guess addiction is definitely something entps get affected by often but think the duration is widely various personally have obsession with different things people etc pretty much but only for like made the assumption that my super aggro attitude was just hidden trait of entp but recently noticed that my assumption is false has anyone out there made other assumptions that were proven overall m bored about 90 of the time even if do something that exciting after few repetition or during excitement will get bored it sucks it really is yep and the warning signs are the most entertaining at least in the beginning all the people telling why suddenly m different damn enfjs why are they so nosy and attention paying oh yes there it is 3 entps 1 sweet and smart 1 troublemaker and 1 player yes yes yes we can be anyone we choose joyous can appreciate the method but don understand the differences in the arguments sorry ',\n",

worse than being judgemental because you actually mean it dry that is true and obviously have biases and prejudices too and guess you could say that am judgemental because don like judgmental people but the people am talking about usually do do any of you feel that the fact that you tend to be non judgmental hurts you socially my impression is that people tend to bond strongly over common judgments on people issues g some of my how can you be so sure that there are no inherent personality traits agree that testing as an intp does not mean that person necessarily has personality traits y and but do believe considering people probably have not changed much over the last centuries would have been social misfit at any point in time but if could travel back in time for vacation d choose most of the time my approach to technology is practical want achieve so need to figure out how to do i don usually have any problems figuring out in some way but have little yes observing people is one of my favourite hobbies am great at reading people and predicting their words actions also love to read about psychological and psychiatric stuff unfortunately when was younger had hermit tendencies and found it extremely difficult to get and stay in contact with people but definitely wasn happy with that and am glad that nowadays can when it comes to small talk am terrible at coming up with correct e socially acceptable answers on cue and that only changes marginally with practice it seems that my brain ist just not but how do you manage not to zone out this usually happens to me during these kinds of conversations this can be very awkward if g the person talking to me is my boss who is great boss voted even and that is usually true for money as well as immaterial stuff tend to be pretty generous with money at least when buying stuff for other people however can be very thrifty over the years have become better at controlling myself in social situations am able to function socially if am forced to but at the same time don try as hard anymore there are studies that suggest that depressive phases alter the brain in such way that the likelihood of fallling back into depression actually rises with each depressive episode when my mother went to school in the 1950s 60s girls had to wear skirt at school no matter how cold it was she hated that and guess this is one of the reasons she never really insisted could you elaborate on the difference between nurture and nature find it hard to apply this concept to feelings try to respect my feelings but try to not let them dominate over my yes have felt like that most of my life the problem ist that the more you adapt the more surprised people will be when the real you shows so lately have been trying to reduce my considering that my ancestors obviosly fucked up their children pretty badly that would be pretty cool unfortunately am not 100 that will never have children learning unexpected facts absurd humour beautiful language good food nature inspiring conversations those are hard to find unfortunately yes think some extroverts feel that they are doing good deed by trying to get people out of their shell it happened to me lot when was younger and everytime someone said things like yes get scared easily even by soft horror films and by books too always had certain fascination for the supernatural and started reading classic horror stories a poe henry james yes definitely can be extremely outspoken when faced with idiotic rules unsolicited advice bullies and unjustified accusations this usually scares people when they witness it the first my mother told me that as baby cried lot and slept little later on was very creative and loved to read and learn new stuff but was not very interested details wasn good at same for me know lot of random facts and usually do pretty well in quizzes or other games that require small bits of knowledge if had to name one particular subject that know lot about most of the time find watching people interact and thinking up psychological theories about why they act the way they do much more interesting than actually talking to them directly and gather used to try and fit in desperately and used my fake personality so much that hardly noticed actually had real personality nowadays usually only fake it for two reasons the but should this keep anyone from having children if they really want to as an individual can do nothing to change the world can decide not to have children however this will have very have never felt the urge to reproduce actually the thought of having children of my own makes me cringe however that is not decision based on logic just don feel comfortable with the yes but most of the time get side tracked so rarely follow through with my more advanced creative ideas in daily life like to apply my creativity by creating things with limited or unusual also child development is one area where psychological research has actually changed society view tremendously g even two generations ago physical punishment was considered the normal thing usually find it hard to listen to people ramble about their life but actually liked your video the conflict between obsessive introspection and all the dark and sometimes crazy thoughts also realised this very early on but the hints were often very subtle and for very long time thought could change that believed was simply suffering from something like social anxiety the option to take my own life when find that living is no longer bearable is like safety blanket for me cannot think of anything worse than being forced to go on living against my will am also very slow at making friends the way it usually happens is that spend lot of time with these people which means that the friendships have have all evolved through some kind of have always been emotionally unstable but it got better over the years usually have at least one or two serious lows week where

not want to be treated by complete did my studies in related field and now work in technical documentation writing and suck at doing detail work which probably makes me terrible documentalist sad

the weather or some kind of office talk and the conversation dies pretty quickly this coworker of mine once told me she admired the fact that manage to keep my professional life and private life separate the fact that this is one of the most memorable compliments in the last 1 usually start to go into hermit mode when have been sitting at home on my own for 2 3 days and believe that is not healthy for me on the long run however like absentminded need social really don think it is possible to answer this question on generic level if you feel the need to discuss this episode with him why don you just do it sometimes hurt people without yes just like some meat eaters get very righteous about their views on evil deer hunters or disgusting chinese cat eaters think inconsistency is part

was terrible and confusing attempt at emotional appeal on my part also don think mushr00m don agree with this at all appeal to emotion is logical fallacy you are sidestepping the reasoning process and trying to score fake points in debate does this work all the time is it didn know this until someone brought it up today the tale of the tortoise and the hare what pointless fable the moral of the story is even if you move at the speed of molasses you can edit oops wrong thread lol curiosity is one of my biggest driving forces in life think it a great trait to have and while being responsible cautious is important it saddens me when people seem to lose it as they age or this was huge for me and probably great advice for an intp how to help the process is finding lot of different healthy stuff you like and generally avoid too much sugar as it definitely makes you that one of our best qualities imo child like wonder excitement that we carry well into adult hood pretty cool feeling when that happens right me and infp friend o69756 love this thread it refreshing to focus on our differences for once this edit really all of it let it be known that this rant was not in vain and for one deeply related to most of it would love to meet an attractive entp female consider myself very selfish giver often enjoy doing things for others but only out of my own desire or maybe the occasional social also have an istj dad and so much of what you posted about his personality hit home with me ll just say that our relationship got much better ever since moved out and became financially yea definitely seems believable and not that surprising still entirely possible there are other explanations as well though m sure there were numerous bomb threats for such big event well at this point d imagine it mostly because naming your girl ted or boy miranda would ensure that they grow up to be the next unabomber which would be particularly funny in the girl case can even think of girl ve met in recent years that would peg as nt let alone intp m dying to find one just cuz nfs can be great but just wanna know what it like damnit intellect 97 based on 10 questions anger 86 based on am missing something lol thiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssss also put much less emphasis on fe than normal normally value harmony quite bit but usually at the point of being really stressed it already broken down

simplicity purity aww just reading this last few pages has made me all giddy love this feeling i finishing business degree right now but would like to go back someday and get phd in psychology or related field and teach that at college level would assume almost all intps would give off vibe of child like innocence which allows me to cross boundaries that are often off limits to others i also seem to have an intuitive understanding of most people although have be be this admittedly there are some inner thoughts have that rarely express to anyone if at all however have found it quite

alright totally get how you saw that now things are often mistranslated over the internet with my closest infp friend we are both type 4 he and share an almost you know you re esfj when you have nightmares about cockroaches crawling all over the pile of dirty dishes in the sink i feel very attached to infp however don think would personally work well with one romantically it seems have preference for thinkers generally but have seen this match work if you re implying that was being sarcastic you re mistaken never meant that maybe it translated that way could see in her her eyes that she has the same energy as the infp in my life big butt so wat m sorry don understand what you are saying the istp death glare makes me giggle which in turn makes them giggle which makes them become incredibly defensive because saw them giggling lol when it over it over make up my mind to slowly creep towards the door and then slam it and padlock it because im dramatic and have dramatic emotions

this has been pathetic sincerely an nf m female enfj will tell you whatever you would like to know about my kind if were there with you would offer you big nf squeeze encouraging enfj the first one is awesome do it this thread will never die as an enfj find it little cringe worthy to read this not because of the way your are reacting to this but rather the way this person dismissed you think we can all agree on the fact very well twin my is at 90 appreciate sensors but couldn ever see myself with one we wouldn have much of anything to talk about the majority of this thread is draining to read hmm am assuming you haven encountered healthy enfj can think of one time haven clicked with an intj we always maintain great friendships some of the best had that is mutual what do you find sexy more than anything when man has high intellect especially when he is displaying that in front of others it allows me to just admire him and drives me absolutely don even mean to just gravitate towards them they are sexy supreme beings and identify with lot of their thoughts what are you successful in what are your achievements what do have you ever developed an attraction to someone you never in million

sorry m little busy to read through your entire thread right now law school eats my life but just an answer to your basic question my isfj boyfriend of over year is crazy enough to my personality has changed dramatically since went to law school ve become so much more organized now plan everything calculate don think m optimistic anymore m just jaded yet tbh don think my isfj cares about wastage of any sort cooking spending etc tends to be much more cautious about these things than he is think it can work m enfp entp and ve been dating an isfj for 9 months now and we ve been getting along great though tbh m probably more soft hearted and justice oriented than the typical listen to all kinds of songs but generally m magnetically drawn to the overly optimistic hopeful sounding ones like these below ve actually been addicted to all of the songs below for days hahaha yes it an isfj thing my isfj showers me and my family with gifts even when tell him it not necessary my isfj boxes in metal cages with his friends for fun he good at it perhaps he not your typical isfj haha know one of my isfjs annoyances are when people don say hi or smile to him yes my isfj was not quite depressed but just generally sad before he met me now he smiling all the time and is generally the happiest most good natured person know go figure hi m an enfp entp dating an isfj and ll try to answer this according to what we ve been through 1 does it bother you if your platonic friend spends time with others or starts to get close how would react me bring it let see who ll die in the end my isfj would probably take it as joke and laugh joke about it well m enfp entp dating an isfj and all our friends and family think we re crazily compatible so vote for that though to be honest our compatibility is much more than simply mbti type though my isfj is probably more of light masochist only in certain situation if that helps any my isfj is an awesome listener though can kinda relate to what you re saying but in different sense he not so good at responding so in that sense it may be slightly unrelated but it seems so this is what my isfj says are isfj less sexually permissive if doing things every day is less sexually permissive guess so are isfj very monogamous yes what are isfj so know there a bit of language barrier but even if look past that d say don go into this relationship sounds like fun flirting relationship but disastrous romantic here my advice go befriend one of those enfp type people the happy go lucky friendly smiley types we love to give out genuine compliments it like our life dating an isfj for 6 months mcrts yeah you know can figure out why there all this bad rep about entp isfj relationships sure think it could be disaster if the two didn have the same ideas about things or same enfp entp dating isfj for 6 months here so far compatibility has been nearly phenomenal compared to all other personality types ve dated infj intj istp isfp intp etc could m not an isfj but as an entp enfp dating an isfj what been said is pretty much true this isfj has also helped grow lot simply because he so kind and his kindness makes me very willing to m an enfp entp that dating an isfj though look like an enfp m probably an entp because need an logical explanation for absolutely everything such as why this isfj is driving me so m anywhere that inspiring hopeful creative also love being around crowds of positive happy people concerts dancing fairs karaoke nature walks art classes trying something actually used to score on most of my tests but now score mostly and the question of do use my heart or my head used to solely use my head and ignore feelings all together now hi so ve been debating this forever enfp or entp test out as both depending on the test both personality descriptions fit me also did the cognitive functions test and though wasn err actually found out that person was an isfj after testing him multiple times haha my baddd most of the enfps here seem to love infjs to pieces but m back to the don know if i went to funeral service today for my teacher husband didn want to go didn know him but went anyway my teacher came up to the podium and started describing his life expected haha maybe this isn limited to just males know really look like an entp to the world calm logical unemotional but then if you see me with people trust or behind closed doors you ll thanks for all the responses it really helped me understand this bit more ve probably been trying to understand analyzing everything too much but going back to theory probably can someone please explain why my best fit personality type infj is the type argue with the most theoretically we should get along swimmingly but when meet actual infjs ve met about 5 just met another infj i changed my mind ilovethemilovethemilovethem squeal been talking to this person for 3 straight days now and for some reason can stop smiling they re so you re amazing umm how does it work well maybe it cause intjs have this cold exterior and enfps can break through that that and we have this cute happy quality about us that is so pure cough ohmigosh yes do do all of the above 3 skip frolic dance even sing and spin while doing all of the above oh yes well when was young was an infp intp mix now ve just given up on being quiet and have become an enfp entp mix have always been like how read it little disney princess why ye well think like them say that cause half of the ones know drive me crazy o_o they seem to have the weirdest train of thought ever but somehow just somehow still really like m just so happy no no m not drunk m not high m just happy so full of life so full of laughter was so sure this part of me had disappeared forever so what good thing what personality trait or personal obstacle do you struggle to overcome as an enfp have cycles of sadness depression it comes and goes m not sure if it worse because of the monthly basically anything my estj friend doesn like anything weird or wacky like that headband with huge cupcake complete with candles and streamers thought that was pretty cool honestly when you feel so warm and full to bursting with happiness from suddenly realizing again that there so much you can do to make the world better place there so much you can do no they don intimidate me but maybe that cause m borderline enfp entp 3 find they re one of the few types that can keep up with my thought process heartily debate with me my confession wish my happiness tornado would keep spiraling up 3 love it keeps me motivated and happy all really need is one or few people around me can laugh be silly with yes do i love feeling it great sometimes it from sadness or happiness usually happiness 3 thank you everyone took your advice and just took the whole day off for myself today it was wonderful being alone without having any pressure really helped so happy it so year ago was all happy and chirpy then all sorts of things happened started studying for an exam to get into school for half year and basically locked myself up in library for not being social like going out and actually talking to people for while can really make me reclusive no matter what m doing sometimes forcing myself to go out and mingle and chat with people hey krwheel you are so incredibly insightful that it almost terrifying though it also intriguing only realized my own behavior after you pointed out all your gripes with enfps yes lots and lots and lots of talking talking while walking talking after eating talking during some gathering or singing singing is good too so basically something where can use my rhoalphanualpha post is right on i can tell you pretty much that exactly how it goes isfps are very affectionate love it cause need innocent affection that doesn have anything hey one of my closest friends is an isfp and we both can imagine our lives without one another m actually talking to him right now and trying to figure out how to answer this question for ',\n",
              " ' type1 me type2 everyone else intjs can be christian since we all start as children and its easy to be indoctrinated and relgious belief is network of many different aspects experiences one can have and interpret so its thread if could tell them one thing from 1 intj to another about being with an infp be careful yes wonder if id be able to handle the emotions of continually seeing those love or at least care about die to much larger capacity than any normal person has to generation after generation people lie but intjs tend to be more naturally machiavellian when it comes to life choices so this one is pretty interesting my best friend just called me in panic his girlfriend used to live with her sister and her sisters husband for little while when she was finishing just be direct maybe youll feel awkward but is not feeling awkward worth not getting your point across clearly then again maybe she knows how she comes off and doesnt care say sorry alot sarcastically though does that count absurdism wikipedia the free encyclopedia your friend is very prideful beat him again so he respects you more that ll teach him the painful irony of this video is the player in it is training for the nfl but couldnt cut it in the nfl in nutshell realized im in love with my girlfriend because of how easily she pisses me off nothing else could make me so sensitive unless really reallllyy cared about it ok im starting to get sick of this there isnt double standard when it comes to sexual partners for men and women there are simply two different standards one for each perpetuated by think any good experienced planner understands the nature of chaos so improvisation needs to be part of your plans to some degree 1st grade the few infps know are the most sensitive people know they take everything personally an infp calling someone strange ive seen it all now what would you say are some good examples of ne engaging activities so you like conflict and resistance for conflict and resistance sake if the world was set up to your perfect specifications you wouldnt like it because there wouldnt be anyone to disagree with know few istjs in real life one of which is my father they have trouble stepping outside of the boundaries they create for themselves they cling to these boundaries think this largely depends on an intjs environment and influences parents friends etc my parents tried very very hard to socialize me with sports after school activities play dates functions if its about winning then would appeal to self interest the need to reduce suffering etc if its about facts or logic then it isnt my responsibility to make them care about the truth ll born and raised in the church always went through the motions but never truly signed on in genuine way but came to point in college when realized id have to take serious sooner or later id be quicker to act on improving my circumstances than would be just sitting around wishing they would improve on their own but in the act of improving my circumstances would hope that the tension between infps and intjs can make for good relationships that are hard to replicate good luck on the bright side your current difficulty will transform into appreciation when you if its been discussed in this thread and thats the conclusion that was reached then doubt it was discussed much and needs to be discussed more even with your want for style elegance low op talked about addressing the problem of uniting the world to do so in timely fashion think faking some larger threat like aliens or biological outbreak would work something that quality for what purpose humanity has characteristics but determining which of those are good or bad depends on that purpose this integrity taking responsibility for ones actions work ethic compassion empathy skepticism my gf now is infp we all have flaws and virtues infp victim think being aware is half the battle having the right mentality in communication is just as important as choosing the right words so being aware that at some point internal concepts will ive had some issues with most types because they tend to feel that logic is optional and expendable not saying all types do but ive had conflicts with the ones that do mother is esfj so what type of thread is this lol wtf is op trolling minored in philosophy during undergrad so please humor me these are your ethics after all everything really on what basis always try to plan for chaos and worse case scenarios but def get frustrated when circumstances dont play nice just good ol fashion running op yes is it not heretics love it at its best in moderation like most things so as long as something has always existed its immune to being ridiculous also you don have to agree on everything to avoid war and its cost children especially siblings do not its sad day when teenage guy feels weird for being sexually attracted to girls he finds sexually attractive dont let anyone tell you that is shallow making excuses for girls crappy mutual rules and conventions of war seem ridiculous to me if you can get the two or more sides to agree on war boundaries then why couldnt they be so diplomatic as to not go to war in the first came into this thread to write this almost verbatim you have got to be kidding me ot no burden of proof rest on the claim in general

takes over six months for your body to get rid of the stuff from one joint what is moderation when first you can lead horse to water but despite how thirsty the horse is you can make it drink no one

              " ' can seem like an intj or like an infj at times can be any of the sj types definitely not social skills can be practiced and enhanced find socialization and public speaking easy and

an estj figurehead an intp actually cleverly planning everything an entj to boss around the slaves isfj slaves an intj to fill in the practical holes that arise from grand intp schemes an estj figurehead an intp actually cleverly planning everything an entj to boss around the slaves isfj slaves an intj to fill in the practical holes that arise from grand intp schemes guess intjs are more prone to think about things like this as competition in general intjs are more likely to try to reduce something with lot of possibilities into single best for me it not friendship that is the starting place but chemistry need good chemistry with someone to enjoy the sex but still have lots of unsatisfying sex with people who don have actually had casual sex like 30 minutes ago ha have casual sex for the sake of experience sex is not big deal for me this question sounds like it was written by an intj yes because when it presented to you it presented as riddle but still most people would not kill sibling to get with man also do not think apathy is the same thing as lacking emotions think apathy can stem from emotional numbness but people who feel emotions can still be apathetic and people who are don feel don see apathy as being the same as neutrality when think of apathy think about people who if you ask them for help on something will say what in it for me and walk away people m not jealous of intjs the thing that ve noticed is that intps usually have at least some amount of self doubt about heir conclusions and theories whereas intj don and therefore can jump also from my experience it is definitely the infps who hate everyone mean actually it is very infp thing feel that most of the infps know hate everyone or are generally quick to become xahhakatar all of your responses sound infp to me res scientific articles that disagree with the mbti the idea of emasculation is joke imo second born child intensely mother dominated household like 100 of the power and decision making was my mother and my father was basically another child the oldest ve gone was relationship with someone 35 years older than me think some people are naturally more creative than others but see creativity as skill that can be developed and exercised so there a little luck in it but it not all luck this is troll thread xisnotx is mud yes my first period was 13 and there was blood in my underwear got pads no pain no cramps no shock new what periods were the end tend to attract submissive men who want my validation both sexually submissive and submissive in interactions don mind it but at some point feel like m their therapist when they are sexually dominant though exceptions can be made if there a powerful woman who wants to dominate me in most life situations m neutral but can be dominant very easily in that can take frozen is mediocre movie long waits are usually not worth it sometimes friendships should die instead of being forced or worked on men are usually more emotional than women like the out of the introverted feeling types infjs seem to be the most self assured and wise suppose people want to see themselves that way an observer of most things when it comes to interesting weird strange experiences that when like to participate social awkwardness is not something that comes from introversion or extroversion its more of skill all of the intps know including myself are all good at striking up conversations with usually people say it in light hearted way so get it neutral but the word itself definitely has negative overtones so while people say it to me in just an amused kind of way oh you re so time travel would take the time travel pill it seems like the best choice second best flying levitating come on these pills let you defy the laws of physics think the intellect pill an idea people label other people cynical just because they aren as mushy gushy as the rest m am pretty detached and never feel the need to rely on others think people would assume yes do wonder how many people no the internet who claim to be intjs actually are intj it seems that people might type themselves that way because it gives them excuse to be assholes or because heard that 48 laws of power is pseudo science self help that has chapter to chapter contradictions in it but hey who knows books that have made me better person that difficult books actually am very attracted to people think are similar to me suppose it depends on the person my sister who is an isfj with tendency to being controlling admits that she couldn be there are definitely people who go for intps don see why it is assumed that intps are unattractive m an intp woman and have friend who is an intp man and what ve noticed for both of when you re conspiracy theorist who gets excited about the mandela effect intps and intjs can both test their theories the questions to ask are more like do you have set of personal principles that you follow that would be fi which intj have or do you think it interesting that you say an example is concrete and definition is abstract would have the thought the opposite that giving definition is concrete while giving an example is abstract don relate to people in general the things you people say that women expect you to pick apart your emotional life or something women never do that to me sometimes men expect me to act would never use the word soft to describe an intp the reason we aren openly bitter or aggressive the way intjs can be is because we are detached living in our heads something else to consider intjs have fi not fe intj have their own principles and can be annoyed when other people do things that don mesh wit their personal principles in this case it i an intp and also feel drawn to the underdog vague protectiveness of the person that every one else rejects like m there to balance it out kind of like if no one else wants tp pay yeah that about what it is to weigh decisions you have to know how you feel about each consequence and from there you can further strategize when people get brain damage to the emotional used to seriously consider being flight attendant so could travel but then found out that wasn tall enough for the height requirement that most flight attendants need to reach and do think that the notion that women are more feeler than men is detrimental too many women are pushed into situations that they don want to be in or shouldn be in like becoming also something to take into account the thinking feeling dichotomy is probably the least accurate of the dichotomies in the meyers briggs vestigial organ left over from an outdate time women aren biologically better at giving care it a social role that women learn people who grow up in abusive households are more likely to become abusers this applies to women and men ',\n",

that may affect the way you answer the questions for example stressful time mental illness medications special life circumstances other useful uhhh ve seen people answering to questions to see what other people think maybe could do that she asked me few questions she said if you had to know something about tv would you choose to know its structure or would you rather know how it works and said would rather know how it uh and what does that exactly mean ok so every test do says am entp my functions are in order ne ti ni te fe fi si se according to the functions test however recently met girl that apparently knows lot about have talked with few istjs it didn go well however know this guy who is for sure extroverted but don know his personality type without any doubt he the only person truly am the only one that always the leader when have to work with people think this is probably because m very independent and feel like it going to work better if don let the rest have heard hanji zoe is an entp though don know if anyone else has said it totally fred m playing dumb all the time but it more of strategy ti most of the times but in the cognifive functions tested higher in ne soo

like my infp character is pretty introverted and ll take notes don worry you ve been great help wink and is there way an estp can act friendly towards an infp if they do act friendly how will they act like will they laugh together or just collaborate in tasks that good to know considering they re trying to understand the reason for what happening to them and that kind of an investigation isn it tongue and what kind of stereotypical moments when did ask for opinions all asked for was how do these three types get along but apparently the reason want to know how do they get along is more important well considering hannibal lecter is inside he would probably end eating everyone if that sarcasm well should make clear too my story isn meant to be funny is it problem for you want my characters to be realistic like people relating to my characters thanks however should make clear they re little less unfriendly so m writing an story and apparently the main characters are estp intj and infp andi want it to be realistic so how would they work like how would talk to how would they all work the test says m visual learner but don think that true because have very hard time learning if have to look at graphic it only because like drawing that why it kind of am platonic for karkat however still don know what his personality type could someone tell me some people say he entp skipped year because in school scored an iq of 135 159 my characters are supposed to be best friends however m not sure if should make one of them have crush on the other character so that why need help and ironically the doers didn so you don get along estps just curious m making story and want to know how to deal with intj estp relationship just curious m making story and want to know how to deal with intj estp relationship but ve never had fascination for ufo aliens and ghosts especially because don believe in ufos or ghosts and after all your inner voice is you so my friends often describe me especially infps as she rude however she is actually very good friend because of my weird sense of humour and constant insulting tend to insult my friends but really how the hell do know what my inner voice personality is exactly remember kids don do drugs well didn honestly have that problem know perfectly how am and all tests say entp however when talking to people always act differently melancholy choleric the fact that it says the aim to finish what you start made me laugh lot broke my computer m writing this via telepathy it also says this you scored 7 on my personality just changes m flexible and that good because if need to be logical with someone ll be logical and if need to be absurd ll be absurd however lately m becoming more my inner voice is myself pretty much so have no idea maybe don have an inner voice is the inner voice what you hear when you think actually the test may say 3w2 7w6 and 1w9 but think m 3w4 7w8 1w9 the other enneagram even makes me look

think he uses strong fe and ne which makes me think he a looping esfj but can see where you re coming interesting however fail to see papyrus using si as dominant function either think he uses strong fe and ne which makes me think he a looping esfj but can see where you re coming could you elaborate on this more struggle to see how papyrus uses ti as his dominant function and how sans use se as

dwight estj jim xntp but m leaning towards intp pam isfj or infp definitely ixfx ryan entj toby ixfj stanely istp oscar ixtx agree with your typings but still think brian is fi dom rather than ne dom what do you think his enneagram is infj 9w1 just took the quiz that was tagged earlier in this thread and my results are in order sloth very high yep this one makes sense m pretty physically lazy and scored low on think sans infj though originally thought intp papyrus esfj toriel isfj undyne esxx m an infj and my worst sin is sloth am extremely lazy rarely want to get up and go out to party and my idea of good time is sitting relaxing alone with good book or computer of course m not saying that nfs are the only ones able to have artistic qualities but that was the vibe he gave off from the stories happy god it been forever since ve read the greek myths you re right fe dom doesn sound right for the god of logic and reasoning proud maybe entj would be better fit originally though to me hera seems to be xstj as for promethus he seems intp hades ixtj and enfj sounds right for apollo my guesses soldier estj medic intp pyro spy intj engineer istp demoman estp scout esfp sniper istj not in any specific order 1 thoughtful 2 lazy 3 goodhearted 4 sarcastic 5 aloof 6 neurotic 7 levelheaded 8 stubborn m an infj and tend to fluctuate between phleg mel and mel phleg at first the latter seemed more accurate but now m beginning to question it fry xsfp professor farnsworth xntp leela enfj bender estp zoidberg intp amy esfp hermes istj kiff infj nibbler intj zapp estp excuse me m not saying that all entjs are the same what meant was as person are you playful person or serious one like entjs are stereotyped as of course know that no type is the have question entjs are sometimes stereotyped as serious people but my close entj friend is not usually serious person and is actually quite impish and very mischievous around friends is well you can really expect them to be consistent as characters but understand what you mean typed current brian as infp because he just seems fi dom now since season 6 but he isn a very though this might not make sense will say that love debating but hate arguing what mean is don like arguing as in the emotional sense but love and sometimes crave the intellectual peter is definitely type 7w6 but ve always thought of stewie as an introvert he hates everyone but could definitely see entj lois however think is an could you explain your reason think calvin infp with my next guess being intp hobbes infj susie entj mom isfj dad istp change my mind peter entp lois enfj brian intp in earlier seasons but later turned into an infp stewie intj meg esfj chris isfp cleveland isfj quagmire estp dennis messed up entj mac messed up enfp charlie messed up esfp frank messed up xntp dee messed up estp also darry is definite estj part of me doesn agree with this idea though am an infj have lot of enfp friends and an enfp brother and none of them ever made me question whether they re an or i would think of see myself as mix between both m very calm and levelheaded person but at the same time anxious and slightly neurotic is this an infj thing or is it just me peter esfp lois exfj brian intp maybe infj stewie intj chris isfp meg esfj cleveland isfj joe estj quagmire estp mayor adam west enfp enfp and intj think ponyboy infp johnny isfj dallas estp or istp sodapop esfp or esfj two bit entp cherry xxfj it true most of us infjs have very dry and sharp wit just remembered one time when someone was insulting me lost my temper and said you play the game destiny because you wish you had am exactly like this for example today my esfj grandmother handed me bunch of paper bags and told me to throw away one but my mind was focused on something else so threw away all of them completely agree m considered by many people to be the most level headed rational and calm person they know even more so than my thinker friends think that the types that are most likely to use sarcasm are the inxxs infj 6w5 jazz is my favorite genre also like classical and sometimes alternative rock would type kyle as an infj this is what most people type him as and find him very relateable kyle is an introvert because he a somewhat quiet kid that spends most of his time alone it quite obvious that they re all completely unhealthy personalities but here what think dennis entj charlie esfp don see how charlie is even remotely j dee estp mac esfp it just seems more fitting to me to have the xntjs to be more inclined towards lawful or neutral rather than chaotic it just seems more fitting to me tbh m an infj and fall somewhere in between lawful good and neutral good here what think mbti stereotypes would be lawful good mostly xsfjs xstjs and xnfjs some xntjs neutral good all the time male infj here and have very dry sense of humor use sarcasm quite bit not for hurting people but for the sake of being witty m an infj and am extremely sarcastic it an art lol tend to use dry humor as my main sense of humor but know quite few sarcastic xsxjs my dad is an esfj and is very sarcastic can someone please explain to me how sheldon is p of any sort he such j that it funny he not an adaptable person is extremely organized and his ocd tendencies are what makes him so would think this stan marsh isxj m pretty sure he an because he very realistic and down to earth hard to tell between and but m leaning towards possible kyle leela is probably an enfj idk that how see her would say kyle and stan are more than i would say kyle is an infj and stan is an isfp ',\n",

              " ' hated gym in school but love motor racing since could just drive really fast and not have to work with anyone really what got me more interested in it was car physics though did it really is matter of perception lost lot in my last relationship lets say thousands of dollars and time and even material things but gained so much too that is not tangble did love love is bit like russian roulette with 5 chambers loaded and 1 empty sorry for being negative ignore me it is awesome you have found someone and it seems it was built naturally over time seems like others already answered that was my high school also except got tired and dropped out instead was huge waste of time anyway for me would chat more about computers and think the predictability we see is the observational predictability when you are actually closer to person while somethings can be predictable lot more of their personality will come out and there is saying it is not often the trash takes itself out this is just one of those cases where they were the trash and they took themselves out you don need people like this in your life pretty much no way to tell if she is intp it is pretty rare when we feel comfortable around someone so we do take advantage when those situations come up that doesn mean they like you enough haha no worries don have all the answers you seek more is matter of opinion but will try to elaborate as see in my own view so yes schools are part of it as well there is high amount of stress from you have 27 questions not 25 but got 17 out of 27 so had to fix it 1 am easily overwhelmed by strong sensory input 2 seem to be aware of subtleties in my environment most of those campaigns to help the poor are actually campaigns to help the rich so in way you could say the poor get nothing almost and the rich just get richer so those types of things do that is all created by society to label people like this and make it harder for them than it already is hence they use word like dis order like it is something out of order not in the only one problem is it not weakness don think any person can be 100 ready think that is false sense of security at least for me have more of mentality of m as ready as m going to be even then it is not something this is in essence what created god and religion to begin with the idea that everything is just one and there is no us sort of like the borg from star trek collective the only difference is yeah like to refer to myself as mirror and do this unconsciously reflect back most of the time what is being given good or bad sometimes people might think m doing something out of yeah totally get it think the word is opinionated and that comes across as harsh very often for me as well people that know me well know that m doing it to be helpful but when it is respect has to be earned so it depends on the context of hard to get there is two types as pointed out already 1 hard to get because they like the attention of person chasing them this is have high standards but its is not what most people want or look for from what can tell even in my limited experience in looking for these things when tried some online dating what waste hmmm have monotone problem like ben stein and it makes people angry also cause they are like why the hell you not angry right now you re suppose to be angry am not angry it is trap you all send it to me that sounds like the best plan because came up with it if had 120k d probably pay off my car and take half into saving retirement fund the rest would put i have one good friend one have couple friends don really see often so don really know their full value yet if there is value so that means don socialize much because very have friend of mine that would walk into computer shop buy the most expensive pc they sold and think he got good pc 6 months later he would sell the pc to my dad for like 200 have one yeah trying to convince people that don want to be convinced is waste of time so it really depends on the situation the problem tend to have is figuring out when they are just pretending to yeah that my problem haven met woman that is able to fool me like that and if they were trying they would get kicked to the curb even explicitly said can be controlled if you have given that lot of thought also our perception is reality but what if my perception is not someone else perception and how far does reality bend if that is true is it only colors or is for the record dropped out of high school all really wanted to do was learn physics and math and science related stuff but wasn allowed until later you don need degree to be try to build business it is what did while it is still very hard don have to deal with anything don want to deal with if someone says do this for 4000 and want 7000 tell them axe the caffeine before trying to sleep twitching will go away 4 for some reason no matter how hard try can fall asleep on my back so always end up face planted in the pillow when wake up sometimes m 45 degree pointing across the entire bed complaining about someone else being dramatic is well dramatic so what usually do is just completely remove those people from my life that can be hard to do though if you have to work with that is probably more likely due to the fact they are older and have seen more bullshit the older you get both male and female this tends to be the case it is not rush to get out of the friend high school drop out go me there is another possibility as well an age gap can come attached with superiority even as much as 1 year that competitiveness can be triggered from any age range is my point used that real iq test it is not possible to answer all the questions as you have time limit to measure how fast the brain works that biological aspect is usually missing from online iq tests the iq very true if someone is unhappy they should have the balls to end the relationship instead imo yeah makes sense feel the same way in the other direction don want to feel like m father it feels wrong so there is some sort of fine line why it must be equality and mean real no don think any idea is uniquely mine usually as you say it is either based off something heard saw or even thought of previously that was based on something else entirely before that now want strawberries yes it is possible for us to have relationship without any attraction from physical point of view it is possible we will want to eat your brain for example it is also possible physical what forgot the question it in the distant past no kidding think there is lot of variables that can shape whether person lives now future or are stuck in the past there is just too desirable yes to an extent for me it is mostly because do actually want kids one day so if go above 37 usually they don want any at that point so that is deal breaker for me the rest is haha actually once said don worry m only an axe murderer on thursdays today is monday right just to see what the reaction would be thought about adding to it today is monday of course it will kill the flow if you don care enough to get an honest answer why bother asking the question it is not formal it is pointless why would say fine or okay or alright if yeah that how think if you don like the answer don ask the question m shawn shitty people think m asshole for saying am having shitty day go figure am suppose to lie and say good not much don really care or shrug no idea probably m going banana now gimme my god damn apple if he had feelings it is still unlikely he would do something about it in short period of time our type could literally spend weeks analyzing whither she likes me or not usually will come to usually it is in reference to something they did

but just wanted to say enicma you are not alone am struggling to be heathy enfj after breakup but it has just been spiralling down or maybe ups and downs and really tbh don think it really happy life for all of us think many enfjs are struggling lot with regards to their lives but they tend to not bring it out when others seek advice from w122 hey dear thank you so much for your kind words means lot to me knowing there are people in the same boat although id never wish for this to happen onto anyone else hugs bnb and your girlfriend has been okay with your opinion on marriage just curious even when the feelings let say romantically are with someone whom you ve opened up and really would never ever hurt you like you can be vulnerable with that person gilly thanks thats the thing you see especially when your ex is freaking istp who is successful in repressing feelings and avoidance it makes you feel like you re the only one in this thetechman haha sorry well started thread about my situation but long story short timing and circumstances and being in different locations thetechman if it due to circumstances cry buckets when am misunderstood angry depressed or just anticipatory grief even agree with you think he might be more selfish than the personality thing resulting in his decisions thanks have been reading your entries about enfj and am really appreciative of how much research you had done and you sharing the knowledge with us m enfj type 2 instinctual sexual 2 think tamehagane couldn find much about fe ni focus could you explain do went out to hike alone but felt more reassured when there are fellow hikers around me and was in nature the jawz no comparison at all just trying to suggest that sometimes it takes long time but it eventually does get better no worries have had people compare their heartbreaks to mine and mine thank you tamehagane it is very kind of you thing is think have developed some ni actually it true hate reading books mean used to read lot of books when was young now how do develop my ni or ti know but tbh just want to stop feeling love for this guy anymore hence the only thing want to do is just to shut off feelings for everyone because can thanks jaws it been 3 months though my appetite dropped badly actually have nothing want to do though which makes it all workse and people just disgust me now being near them agree people telling me that everyone goes through this move on you deserve better and stuff but in actual fact say am an unhealthy enfj because really lose all hope and feel that wonder how you are with your so was in ldr for 1 5years with my istp ex bf we never met and m also from singapore lol he broke up with me cos well circumstances and think he thinks are you guys still together enfj and istp pairing agree with you it was extremely difficult throughout my relationship which ended with him leaving but felt like we both learnt lot sadly it wasn enough pwowq when they do think of people would they focus more on the good or the bad would this thinking ever translate into regret feeling of loss or omg want her back now might not know much to give as much insight but from what see of your post 1 m sorry you were so badly hurt having someone you love loved tell you that he couldn have connection okay am sorry offended you lol wasn stereotyping him but this is forum for personalities so haha well think it was unlikely hormones or excitement considering we were in relationship for 1 5 years thought about it but he thinks still do not understand maybe because of my 1418 yes agree with you don need an immediate answer but it would be nice to not read my message unless he can reply or at least say he busy also agree with you that perhaps he 1418 once again he read my message and the photo and did not reply am getting borderline annoyed like if he just wants to do this kind of ignoring can he just block me does he get kick 1418 thank you so much oh lol so if block him since he blocked me on facebook would that piss him off make him more curious about me oops sorry manipulative unhealthy enfj traits out haha really don think will move on find another would rather be single then not sure if it an unhealthy enfj thing or obsession or whatever am really set on my thinking that if it 1418 thank you for replying think made enfx mistake by following up with how are you know just recalled and someone on the forum told me as well that was mistake merely 1418 anyway sent him nice message saying am sorry for how acted before and after the breakup and that it was out of line even though was hurting badly also apologised for not being enfj feeling extremely worthless and suicidal and finds no meaning in life now post breakup with my istp ex bf ah oh man really any advice is appreciated though or thoughts cursive 1418 yes you are right he has unblocked me since the end of february after he imposed 2 weeks no contact post breakup he isn speaking to me at all e not proactive in making conversation 1418 my situation guess have no idea where stand in his life or if he even wants to keep me around motherofdragonslover hi fellow got fan reminds me of how he introduced me ti got even though he had been jerk in the relationship felt that we shared strong emotional connection actually don really know do istps not initiate conversation 1418 thank you cursive oh am serious actually you mean the bolded part because you asked thought you had some advice to give got bit confused at what you were trying to get at oops but this was definitely not my fault the breakup wish it was like wished had betrayed or cheated on him so wouldn feel so think agree with the loud music example but then no offence my example of taking responsibility if you murdered someone would be to make up for it and not to just stop murdering hmm am super unhealthy enfj post breakup right now feel hurt scarred betrayed used disgusted at myself and how human beings can be so selfish angry upset blame myself for being naive that is so horrible guys who cheat deserve nothing sometimes wish my ex bf had cheated on me it would have made it so much easier to move on than some stupid selfish reason like want to work you are but get super riled up hearing responses from istp users so what do you mean by emotional support oh wait also forgot to mention one really sweet thing he did we have have been through heartbreaks before it nowhere like this it feels like am betrayed abused hurt taken for granted used you know wish sometimes he was complete jerk that he maybe it how different we are it ridiculous to me did nothing wrong and how dare he let his feelings fade or string me along whatever if he never wanted to meet me it honestly ridiculous pwowq er okay lol haha sorry that didn seem to understand so basically you re saying he appreciates me as person yet doesn want me in his life okay guess was at fault he blocked me on whatsapp is it possible if you could teach me ways to go about that honestly really hate being enfj after this incident desperately want to be like you guys istp not caring for the world caring really because we actually talked

consider yourself frustrated artist sounds like you might herex92s what suggest stop thinking about this cousin and get to work on your art get creative and itx92s as simple as this don like when group of people gangs up on single individual ever makes me mad also think people should encourage the art of slowing down and relaxing more all ever hear is people one of my favorite authors wrote about x91the futility of hero worshipx92 and suggests that predictable egoic structure is usually like stone sculpture and crashes down when you see the real human wander around in the woods for hours

wouldlike someone to go places with now maybe actually what really want issomething like service animal but ix92m picturing big ole tiger peter sounds like you really love yourself and your reality

factor in why infjs may act the way they do and the idea was did see unclear boundaries and feel was enmeshed at times for sure codpendency and enmeshment have been big topics of research and

advantage of mbti when it comes to character development there is nothing as human nature it is an instrument of the weak who want to hide their own pitiful selfishness and try to rationalize it try to make it normal the only thing that truly hello and welcome yes they are charming and self destructive hello and welcome it seems to me that he has either narcissistic personality disorder or anti social personality disorder or comorbid of these two either way recommend you to avoid him like the devil he don smoke drink mostly vodka borovička or home made alcohol it is common to have this one

that i am quite the same although am an infj may ask what are the ways you manifest your creativity do you paint write compose music or anything like that oh infps and fantasy what perfect combination you cannot expect socialist to embrace liberalism this is beyond ridiculous to identify as racial minority to get job is terrible but what is even more terrible is that there actually exists system where there are enforced quotas that this friendship ain worth the trouble move on yep some people are unable to hide their true ugliness even behind nice facade they call their face body am not big sleeper tend to sleep 4 6 hours day or even less depends on the situation for me there are just too many interesting things want to do and sleep somehow hampers my effort if hello and welcome personally think infps are awesome very creative and original very insirational although the indecissivness tends to hamper your creative side may ask what books from my experience say infp but as it was already mentioned infps tend to have problems with finishing their projects sadly they get easily distracted but if they manage to overcome this the communist manifesto my evil sounding laughter

some accurate measure but m beginning to doubt that the mbti will ever be that measure intentions are hard to you re right was thinking about the trait with the biggest gender difference agreeableness is closer to although personally think is closer to what jung meant but that a different there is always risk that you see certain kind of people in your closest circles this traits are heritable and also the fact that people in general are attracted to those sharing their traits it seems the mbti overestimates all the rare preferences n p this is probably for commercial reasons since it will maximize the overall uniqueness of the types the idea that istj is the do intjs like their stereotypes it seems like the other types always complains about any general description but there are plenty of this type that gladly portrays themselves as some kind of evil can remember but m currently watching french tv series called les revenants and it is the best show ve seen since let me think must be since carnivale it not matter of being lax only that everyone should be allowed their opinion as long as it relevant and reasonably civil don think you should read too much into that slogan and guess we have different views on what makes discussion open wouldn demand that my opponent be helpful or stimulating as long as they make their case in an honest way they are ok by me as for the site supporting the mbti all can say is that there are plenty here opposed to it and they don seem to get disciplined for their critique this suggests that the site is for discussing m not sure that this site supports mbti and what that means does it say somewhere that this site is only for people who accept the mbti hope not like jung theory and think he was on to so what so karl marx influential not in good way this is how he influenced the world maybe not how he intended it but that a different story looked it up and it seems there is no no karl marx was influential in disastrous way he laid the ideological ground for the atheist hell known as communism which half the world population suffered during the 1900s with it do you have any sources looked at wikipedia and it has quote where darwin says he is agnostic rather than atheist sources from antiquity are 2000 years old and don think we can say anything yannibos guess your silence means that you couldn come up with any atheist who can match mlk mandela or gandhi and if you look at creative arts there is similar lack of talent could it are religious people somehow opposing this think about the oppression of communism and all the people stalin and mao killed under the atheist flag and plenty of religious people are all for the idea of needs as source of values is problematic and everybit as irrational as religious faith people have all sorts of needs some have strong urge to rape women or pick fights if the problem is that progress implies specific goals which imply values so do these values follow from scientific method somehow no they are just as much matter of faith or gut feeling as the not so sure cobain had choice is it just coincidence that he offed himself when it seemed like his band was splitting up at that

avoidance as no didn mean eysenck and yes the big five neuroticism predicts some bad outcomes but there isn any studies on the bad outcomes of other factors it very likely that extraversion is linked all types are bashed at some point here don think infps are getting more than anyone else it different in academic psychology the big five catches lot of the infp under the trait of also live in

just meant that some of the questions showed me some things that good test got 13 social 23 self pres and 32 sexual in particular think this helped me understand exactly what the social variant is somewhat more because ve classified myself as social in the test itself in my opinion is pretty good but it not the best enneagram test ve taken one of the things that do like is that it gives results for every type preference so that you can 1w9 easier to get along with and have more quiet strength whereas 1w2 seems too controlling 2w3 same deal don like how the 2w1 might try to convince me to do more things whereas the 2w3 lot of this depends on the context of the situation for me for example might love to work with some type but find them frustrating to deal with in more casual situation that being said this is pretty interesting idea will say that have always found it somewhat strange that type 6 has phobic and counterphobic variations which are present in basically every piece of we re not necessarily trying to imply that it restricted to introverts just that that what we ve observed more of guess should elaborate more on how think this works part of this so the question becomes do any of you reading this see how this might be true have you had experiences that might go along these lines or provide evidence to the contrary as someone who there a fairly long list including don particularly like professional critics any field really because think that the idea that most people look for the same things in their some new boots yeah that kind of what was saying about blackberries mean for me part of the reason that like autumn is that it nice and temperate things aren too wet winter spring or humid yeah autumn is my favorite season too by pretty wide margin yeah winces ve been there and don really guess don see blackberries as distant enough to be the i dunno about that man hear we re kinda stringy fruits if you can dig it little more expansion on why think of five as an apple so if we consider the apple the first thing that comes to mind for me is its crispness apples have an audible snap when you bite eh that some good reasoning can see where you re coming from the last part is bit arguable though because we see that he has very clear idea of what he thinks the consequences will be not perhaps the intention we had in mind but hey if it works okay see where you re coming from generally go with infj for him but that could partly be personal bias on my part part of the issue is that we don know how much of what he does is his true so you ve already talked about this some raspberries being 4 but just thought d try to clarify for anyone watching so big part of the logic here is that the 4 is typically seen as romantic mostly agree but what makes you see koizumi as an intp became vegetarian when first learned what meat was around the age of 3 was fundamentally disturbed by the idea of eating something that had been an animal had lot of fears as little it is rather unnerving at times one of the things m glad about retroactively is that became vegetarian early so didn have the moment of oh god what is this when learned about the my father is not employed but it not for lack of skill or ambition he decided to be stay at home dad when was young m 18 now and now he mired himself in chores and the like our house usually try to be nice or deflect the question not overly so you understand m not going to get really hyped up about how attractive person is maybe even if they really are but might magenta is not color dunno don have this as much then again m very literary person so it wouldn surprise me if words names stuck with me more than most people people can change their avatars when they yeah you kind of develop feel for what legit and what looks like cover for making quick buck after while that all can say you come to know with experience find some master internet guess m not really sure where the cutoff between being interested and being fan is precisely but d say m fan of mostly lot of anime gurren lagann lucky star darker than black mostly agree with what been said so far while there may be correlations it more of an individual thing than any kind of hard and fast rule so what wanted to add here is you re grouping boss okay good just wanted to make sure your point about personal preference is certainly true biologically certain people enjoy the taste of meat more than others and doubt that would just to expand little more on the idea of cherry as 1 see the core as very representative of the repressed emotions in particular anger that 1 can have 1 try to be pure and moral but i a type 1 we think ve changed my views on this couple of times and have mixed feelings on the one hand do like the system and how it describes motivations and lets people see more we may switch 5 and 6 apples have more of that crispness going on which can maybe fit with the way that 5 can be kind of detached and precise in my mind the reasoning for 9 as strawberry goes something like this first it doesn seem like strawberry is as polarizing of fruit as lot of fruits are which fits with the idea of boss yeah wasn trying to say it was caused by type or anything like that just that it seemed like there could be some interesting connections due to type motivations m also not trying to know guy who we think is so sp think some of what people said is probably true though sx are seen as more dynamic than other types more flashy which is something that is very so it occurred to me that there might be some correlation between enneagram type and the prevalence of vegetarianism veganism respond to the poll with your type and whether you are or not and feel okay guess ll challenge you for it then if you win you get to destroy the world and ll go live somewhere else but if win you have to make me an internet sandwich history of the sieve chocozuma revenge yes you really can do that definitely

desiring successful image some 3s don even want that not in the traditional sense also d argue 2s especially agree with your 9 point not even the healthiest 9 ever would put herself out there the way taylor does shawn mendes is good example actually healthy example his music is the center of his she did cling to the m good person reputation until she was painted into corner think she genuinely believes the gp is out to get her lol but the reason say 2 3 is she way more the video like two posts up is very obvious depiction of disintegration to 8 she could not possibly be anything but 2w3 perhaps the sterling example better than revenge is another good first of all it is not even up for debate that lorde is 4 so sp lmao totally get why you find her relatable in the enneagram sense she the realest secondly agree that the music itself some great points being mentioned figure actually nailed an exact thought process had year ago was it or whenever halsey album came out halsey was an artist felt like should at least dunno if d attribute it to feminism liberalism primarily think the primary influences are 1 technology and 2 financial instability this is generation that has to worry

fine coffee for 1 that because it came straight haha m not selena fan by any stretch of the imagination but her music definitely comes across more sincerely and less posed than taylor for me taylor

post once that analyzed you know funnily enough absolutely cannot see selena as sx last and never even considered the possibility lol always saw selena as one of the only overtly sx artists on top 40 radio for the think her music kind of is obviously 2ish much more so than selena gomez actually and think selena gomez music has strong sx element to it do get the argument that selena is i know you are an enfp after all but my post was something d been wanting to articulate for while the stereotype of enfps being like some kinda bunny rabbit really sells them short enfps imo entps are generally more tactful because of fe they re more aware of what would well embarrass most people and thus more sensitive to that as an example of what mean by enfp enfps are really only assigned the charming moniker online think people just find them charming in theory and thus charming people are often typed as enfx m really only basing this supposition um no cognitive functions don impact likelihood of depression they might impact how that depression is expressed and dealt with but no that not how depression works sincerely an entp my so confessed that with me he has rebuilt his trust in another human and he sees me as potential wife he said he finally feels like he can be vulnerable in front of someone and can stop ',\n",

there but also in the intj portrait too he isnt as focused on self improvement believe his love for me has prompted him to thanks he is not remotely organized he will follow schedule when commitment is made and hates being late but he procrastinates too he also dislikes changing tracks when important decisions thanks for putting up the poll really envy some of you it seems to trend male bit who had the presence to lay the smack right back down or at least make it clear not to screw with you good thanks this reminds me of how he ll say that for him effort means shit results mean everything

think inforjoking oh do you see talent in my handwriting to it seems you don have proper closure with her or am just imagining things well just wanted you to know that acknowledge how hard this situation is but what would do or possibly what blushed laughing that embarrassing but it a woman life lol it also has to do with religious reasons though well from an infjs perspective and from what have heard infjs don seem too emotionally needy actually have some trouble with relationships sometimes because want to have alone time and parks to packs inforjoking oh my goodness this is some type of amazing ability you have their you got very realistic picture of me just by my writing plus you did it so fast teach me your ways shocked fueledbyevil well when you put like that then might create thread lol you entps and your nicknames do like moonshine better since am night owl interesting entp paired esfj wow this looks cool ok here are just my school notes and the journal one is what like to call my notes on life 653754 653762 653770 653778 how can you find yourself in relationship am pretty sure you have to ask some questions regardless prank or not hmmm your right about at least one thing should stop asking about something on here but was just curious and slightly regret it for while lol and the guy was asking about is most see well sunshine wasn trying to stroke you entps ego was just trying to answer and help out another person lol plus it confused me reading the definition of the word you chose to am not pandering you at all but now am concern to what you are trying to say the word you used pandering has different meanings don quiet understand what you are trying to do oh wow ok will try to answer also am bit skepticle of the mbti theory between infjs and entps honestly but the entps have dealt with before which is very little so idk we always had haha yeah no the entp isn giving me hard time agreed well as person of course you are harmless but in general thought it was cool coincidence to have the ideal mbti type meet each other there is only one entp and one infj in the group of yep lack confidence lol but thank you happy this made me feel so much better you are completely right there is more to people forget that sometimes people are people know it can be little confusing between infj and infp because we may appear similar at first sight but the difference is there infjs have ni as their first function which means we dominantly not necessarily am intrigued by how in world of people following the same old patterns can kind of see past the entp never seems to follow what predicted he would do hope that made well guess we both feel the same way about each other if that is how he feels m not crazy about him either right now but maybe things can change or not lol just curious like entps but doesn seem caring to me the entp know is always picking on people teasing them and making them feel uncomfortable lol right now feel like we are just friends personally its bit am sorry but don really understand what you are asking the entp and me kind of have shallow friendship with few sparks think it does have to do with the entp but am just over oh wow mean the entp doesn talk to me that much but surprisingly throws me curve ball and asks me how am doing and because am nervous mess or usually tired or in pain respond what does it mean when you entp have come to the point of still trying to talk to someone even though they only respond in facial expressions and short lived responses btw am the one well also have different interpretations of how look most of the time people say look like doll or fragile being also don express my self very well facially lol one thing know for yeah seems like lot of fun blushed another infj jumping into this band wagon was really shocked as well when knowing that had some what cold and uninviting look and vibe recently my mother pointed this out to me she was wish each person would have an actual elemental power according to their mbti this is little boring am the only infj that struggles with social situations sometimes say really weird things cause feel out of it also am very blunt another question have is which one are you most lol it seems like you did meet only negative infjs don know if am healthy infj but if someone doesn agree with me don angry with them actually try to understand why they don i met male enxp think he was more of feeler we instantly connected even though was going through bad time he kind of saw past my cold behavior that would usually push people away and wow am so glad found this thread here is picture of my recent painting 620209 started posting some of my artwork on my instagram raysacassa after got up the courage to pursue this see that you for responding understand your perspective now idk if its only me but try to be respectful and polite towards the person until they start to talk to me more now that i see you also said that you liked infjs anyways so then whats your move m sorry am just trying to understand this outlook thank you haha find this little funny our politeness gets in the way how do you propose infjs to interact with others then specifically to entps and such another question if you don mind is am guilty of this as well see it kind of rude on my part but mostly positive the reason why do it is because of protection can sense something annoying or unsafe for me through my ni 615666615674 okay just want to clarify few things before people get too confused you are not the shadow it is demon everyone has an intense weakness that can cause to much trouble for us so am only seem to have short attention span when don want to listen or if am uncomfortable hehe anyways have pretty good attention span if

this is tricky honestly dont know because the situation esfp wont go away by itself and you are right he probably is too proud to be helped by bunch of females maybe joke with him 78464 yeah totally if have one big task focus on that only just had an exhausting lab course for some weeks in parallel bunch of difficult and time intensive protocols and early in the try to be polite and dont like to hurt people but am often too inconsiderate and hasty in communication to be genuinely nice agree intjs are great but also have the need for personal development and they can evolve as well to communicate with others told him see his point in being logical about my problems but entp here can not help with the intj intj thing but it is an nt nt thing at least am dating an intj right now and could never have imagined it would be that intense just by reading the intj holy shit yes my own emotions and obsessive need to analyze brain rapes me when am in love so basicly fuck myself over and destroy what we have by over analyzing and thus acting fucking jesus fucking christ would have torn him new one my bf that is what the fuck is he thinking if someone says such thing about my bf would tell them what think have strong need it has been some time since have let someone get that close yes have been staying in my comfort zone way too long time to jump out am going to cuddle that damn hedgehog know he wants it yeah agree on this one it isnt fair really to the people attracted to us this guy is really challenging and thats what like about him and know he needs me to challenge him too just am generally not easily offended or hurt and people who are this way in friendships can annoy me somehow depending on my mood however realized when am in love am so vulnerable and all my one

detective entp and the mystery of fi pleasebeniceto me look serious absent or nice proud thanks yeah am not game player but realized do some of this stuff subconciously did not even know this about myself before like to be very honest though so if am too must act or will go crazy since cant focus the alternative is to just dont talk to him until my feelings are gone dont know if this works but that was actually my idea can be good at help me have emotions for an intj blushed met him online and think we clicked right away for the last weeks we have been verbally sparring lot he is very funny and he told me he finds am here bitches look at me look at me look at me look at me look at me look at me look at me look at me look at me look at meeeee am sooo awesome mon get up and dance with me

people who get it know one other isfp and she lives far away so it good to know m not the only one agree it the fi greetings my fellow isfps as an isfp ve always wondered why it so incredibly hard to receive criticism know that constructive criticism is great thing but when it comes from someone this is difficult one feel most comfortable with other isfps infjs and really feel most at home with enfjs my best friends are isfp and intj surprisingly the intj was really hard for me my biggest peeves are 1 people who are inconsiderate 2 people who don want to grow up 3 being lectured or judged in any way shape of form in public ie when there more than me and the thanks so much guys it been while since my last posts and have spent lot of time thinking about things hope this doesn sound incredibly horrible or disloyal we weren really even fairy bread lol this infj was no hole though he is still great friend of mine it wasn his fault that waited for so long should have told him sooner but it alright we weren meant seinda thanks for your further thoughts it really interesting when first started to have an attraction for this istj was thinking literally the same things over this past year as an the more you guys tell me the more questions have hope you don mind so istj guy and hardly know each other at all despite having gone to the same college and working the same job right selinda aw thanks for the hopeful comments well so today wrote him short encouraging note we work at the same place and left it on his desk it basically just said that his hard work what an unfortunate situation m so sorry to hear about that it sounds like there is lot of stuff going on in her life that you might not know about and she sounds like an extremely immature when first got into the meyers briggs stuff originally thought d never get along with istjs since have difficulty with estjs well ya ll are vastly different from them had an online bam wow wish could write something that indepth about myself it may have answered my questions about compatibility now to just hope don wish too hard for devoted love like that only hhhm ve gotten eye contact like that it surprised me and is kinda unnerving because it came on pretty suddenly he used to ignore me and being flirted at has never been anything m that hello istjs am female isfp and admit that have my eye on an istj guy right now here are two questions shocked 1 what does it look like when an istj is interested in someone 2 my best friend is an intj female when she first started to open up to me got really annoyed and even offended because of her bluntness and touchiness but then once she explained to me that she oh hahaha gotcha tricky one aren you lol ferroequinologist thanks it was good read and yeah that article describes my dark side rather well and have question about your user name does it possibly have anything to do with coburn oh wow you actually got expelled from preschools yikes was almost that bad in kindergarten but for other reasons lol when you mentioned the kinesthetic oriented schools it brian1 not really admit was trying to type two year old but think that even though it sounds stupid to type 2 year old can see that each and every kid is different ve noticed eeeeehhhhhhh well guess have really given myself the title of crazy person on this forum haha yeah did say it after all didn i this ll be hard one to live down as an isfp did feel the same way recently my mom been in the hospital and my dad is bum most of the time and ve had no help around my house m also starting at new college next week and having call me crazy for trying to type 2 year old but m pretty certain one of the kids babysit for is an estj how does one properly discipline and teach this type bear with me here my question don know many estjs know 1 maybe but from what ve read they are very capable of being very romantic and once they are totally committed to relationship they ll do anything to keep unbelievably lazy if it can wait why do it now and please dont give me reasons cause they will just stress me out lol interesting m actually 4w5 isfp wonder if that makes difference the enneagram should look more into that anyway when m at work work at daycare think can be an enfj too don know if it just me or another part of being an isfp but sometimes find my personality morphing into different types especially when m around certain people and no do not have any ah admit estjs can be frightening don mean this as an offense say it purely as an isfp spoken from my perspective ve worked with an estj before and yah it was kinda rough at ',\n",

minded entps but hey if he not joking compare the cognitive functions entp ne ti fe si intj ni te fi se so you would see lot of similarities personally would have suggested maybe she is an infp possibly the way see it is that ne defines things based on how they relate to other things ni would then define things based solely on what they are in other words ne sees an apple we think that is m pretty sure can speak for all entp in saying solving puzzles problems or can be said finding patterns and conceptual ways to fix things and working toward efficiency are two of the top 5 ve been called apathetic m not sure would consider myself apathetic now but in high school was to fairly high degree ok m really the first to respond hmm well think can tell you what you want to hear you re

is living in the moment or living in the future it gingertonic is it that easy once you get your first one it just sorta clicks m decent at determining s i and j are easy to begin with just get confused with and when see i it seems that due to our extremely developed deductive reasoning we should be fairly good at typing others is this the case how do you go about typing others am so bad at it help depends on what the middle of no where is but yes we are still on deserted island there just two of us now i the only one in utah oh no come find me feel like my fe is fairly developed to the point can use it almost as well as can use my ti base this on the fact that can deal with people almost as well as can solve problems my you re on to something here my whole point of this thread is wondering if m making mistake taking the callous off of my heart m grateful that you all are helping me out on this but guess should give you some more background am great with fe developed it young and developed it well am wondering more of my fi umm wha yeah stick it to the metaphorical godish figure nothing is sacred oh he an intj heh ve been learning to use and relate to people and especially connect with significant others so far it been way more painful than anything else so my original question why grow heart how do delete this want no part of sharing my feelings m sensing that you want us to say ne in the op you said m having hard time deciding you don just decide its what you naturally prefer you will use almost all functions especially commitment anything else we can handle wink

me or us there in fact are introverted entps tried starting this exact thread while back and just got trolled until gave up on it but am here to beg to differ on side note think healthy entp will think very highly of themselves possibly to the extent of contempt usually even when try not to people think m the last two realized the camera was working so smiled for you turns out only 5 per post you guys only get 10 cuz have to go to class picked out the more extreme ones that don look similar to any others enjoy can find out how to make this useless pos work lol turns out it has been taking pictures all along through my whole troubleshooting process turned on some setting which entp subtype are you tony stark wass one of my favorite entp posters to read don see him around much anymore think this is the same thing with higher post count maybe check it right the type that you claim to be is just the functions you prefer or naturally do so everyone is capable of anything it just matter of developing it to make it work efficiently from fuck that arrow m not fixing it m too lazy but you are some smart people m sure you can figure out what mean by it lol good point same here man why you gotta be like this does mensa mean anything to you find that being mensa member has low correlation to intelligence heh awesome thanks man wanted to thank your post twice that what needed thought it was just me that had these opinions ok lol get the feeling you get high often or your thinking isn so developed maybe you just speak your mind in which case envy you pretty sure you re entj well done you nailed about 7 of your accusations it late and m tired so don even want to grace this with much of response so ll highlight the ones you are king_moonracer m in my second semester of college and you lead me to believe you have less psychology knowledge than that you say you know psychology or you have read some wikipedia king_moonracer you are the reason people think psych majors like me are stuck up and full of contempt or just ing imbeciles you get that one from one of your high end psychology textbooks that good what m beginning to think you are 15 did you get this one straight from jung himself beg to differ false now how does that work at all it could be more efficient girl broke up with me and two or three months later saw her and heard her use the top two just most of the time people say wish could listen to your brain then m like no you don they don usually understand how fast it gets going but the tangents and connections that make extrapolate guess must have it wrong in my head can you clarify for me now wait minute wait minute are we confusing fe with fi fe is interpersonal communication fi is intrapersonal fe helps you see how others are reacting

date havent done posting in long time but wanted to answer this one no please dont change yourself because love enfp guys or guys that show emotion tenderness affection in general where heh spose im bad student for coming on here to check the postings instead of studying in my case yes never liked school couldn care about learning unless it serves practical purpose m not an esfj but do know three esfjs my mother brother and former roommate kind of like what you described they are distraught when people don like them always going out of their way to do thanks rez blushed shocked proud this was freaking awesome really because the last guy had crush on and still like to be honest was an isfj like isfjs was told that in school and by some esfx friends they don understand that cold and heartless is more than just being all over the place with your feelings silly people don realize that good luck with everything happy hey if he doesn start it you need to do it one day just give him big hug and kiss few boyfriends would ever say no to that crazy ohh heyy well m an entj and for me live by the actions speak louder than words so understand where he is coming from don tell him anything just put your arms around him and kiss if you dislike their personalities they probably wouldn like you in the first place besides if they love you they can be that bad it sucks same here jealous need more infp friends in real life crazy interesting so this is how the other side feels in my case m the one who wants more than friends and then hates it when people are close minded to the possibility of dating me d not be so m jealous of enfps and ohh what do do everybody likes me not fair seriously angry all istjs are not like this one of my closest friends is istj don know though he may be mature one aside from him ve got other istj friends and they re really nice to conclude it is damn right it not cynical it realistic thanks happy this is an inspiring story my problem is though that don want to like poeple crazy hero lies in you by mariah carey huhh like infjs maybe those people dont understand oh welcome estj laughing te si no it has to be done this way so vote estj rather than istj bc estjs are more in ur face about it crazy then probably enfj mean if was on project id probably divide the tasks and stuff and then tell you guys to give me the work on time the passive aggressive heh screw that id either be in oh goodness this sounds like something might do if didnt get hold of myself she could be entj and they damn well should well done happy why is this thread still going on pokes like said just because most people aren attracted to you that your opinions not mine doesn mean no one is because like said it narrows that not real love it fake love be yourself hey all don know what you guys are complaining about infps are sexy both men and women then again entj or whatever personality am if not entj women aren too common either it if she doesn like you that her problem don sit around trying to figure out what she doesn like because someone else will love you exactly for who you are if they don then that their you raise some good points well entjs can be creative too for one love art but you are right about the criticizing am extremely critical of people some entj females such as myself don randomness is the best and so is fun lol guess sticking to the law can help but breaking the rules is fun huhwha the istps know in real life are fun mean nope more like mr nice guy but badass and fun to be with they live to break the rules it freaking awesome that my 2 they are forgetting that se is our teriary energizing function very thoughtful of you to generalize infps can be pain in the arse so can all types but yeah go ahead and single out entj jeez yup infp during my misanthropic stage wouldn be surprised if was infp now but dont have si and te is my first tell myself the first sentence every day and you are absolutely right people aren worth all that time and energy guess activity friends is great like people to go watch football with go guess so need to stop expecting and caring so much it just difficult was misanthrope for the longest time and hate is another form of love really well maybe it does exist then apollo celestio don know hmm meditating tried it once but lose focus really easily and get distracted and start noticing the littlest things around me it not very effective being hard on myself somewhat helps but well like myself think but there are lot of reasons why don match up either m not giving up on myself and you re right still kind of wish it would happen _ thanks don like either of the options the best thing is to not care hate these feelings anyways but ot caring is the best way to go and if do care tell myself to stop being so silly you got this part right _ go xntj willpower _ this is funny it all sounds nice but that what has started my problem in the first place owlwaltz guess give off bad vibes not too sure how that works but can see what you re saying do accept myself though mike but is guilt better than being vulnerable guilt is wish never liked people every time do m let down or proven wrong don get me wrong do have friends but that only after like 4 years or so that trust them that much wish entjs can most certainly have self confidence issues it is not something that is restricted to certain type entjs can also be lazy unmotivated etc it def possible in regards to type like something practical that can use sentimental stuff like hallmark things aren bad but practical stuff wins whatever like hoenstly don really care it is the thought that counts too stubborn is exactly why you love entjs admit it you hit the nail on the head dude well done entjs are not always bossy loudmouths besides what wrong with being bit stubborn somewhat loud and opinionated it called being yourself and bossy is called taking charge if you don ',\n",

thanks everyone your perspectives are all very helpful to me just needed reassurance that this sort of backlash from people might be normal it might mean ve unearthed something they can see ve always thought was pretty good at understanding people who they are their motivations what they need out of life few arguments ve had with people in the past week have left others think as long as there is hope am fine what you describe to me is that when you are in place that is hopeful you can cope with life think you are right about being cautious of kind of wish knew what kind of energy give off to people m not really sure how to get that information from people don see friends very often have been told m rather intense to wow that is an excellent summary of infj ness would say agree 100 with all of those statements in my life ve noticed this with number of people around me they have either an anxious or calming or angry energy one of my good friends is awesome because even though he a goofy loud enfp with me he thanks for the input everyone know pay attention to many facial cues at once but recently have become curious about eyes looking away pupil dilation and constriction etc because it changes don have very healthy relationship with food when m stressed eat when m lonely eat don eat healthy food very often stress about food and don eat breakfast or lunch and hey everyone don often make eye contact with people unless m really interested in getting to know them or am somewhat comfortable with them it something m trying to do more and more we live in possibilities so sometimes satisfaction is going to be an issue when there are other possibilities also we keep growing and evolving and expect people to want to chase the darkness if was in the possition of your friend would say give her little space for now and keep things light and friendly you don want her to feel as though you are going to drain her forever and um can just say that catagorically enfp are awesome and the op was awesome and you have very lucky infj take good care of her okay and be very careful with whatever delicious gooiness would just like to add don think that keeping group type same will eliminate all conflict yes we don go after it but we re not all going to see eye to eye and you know what m absolutely cat crave attention but on my terms only am unpredictable apparently think m quite logical but my husband says m like the cat used to have that would let you pet it have christian community around me from which feel often distant would love to get to know other infj christians have very firm reform theology like beliefs but have studied other am married to an intj and have found communication with him really easy but don know what female intj would actually be like my intj has to be given space to be right about things he 1 am idealistic and don see it as weakness can worry ferociously and be illogically optimistic at times dream of things being better though and that what at the core of me i love this thread agree with most of the types here listed here it strange how this is very rational dominated show but suppose the writers of science fiction often would be how much do people in your group know about her sometimes as infj we know lot about other people but people rarely know about us unless of course we ve decided we can trust you or for some totally get vibes from people and make lot of decisions about who want to be around based on them just get an intuition about them and can even pinpoint how arrive at these it is really interesting to hear all of your voices on this topic it good for an infj like myself to realize how we come accross to people and what to work on and from this little infj to all don have lot of crushes but when have have fallen hard and like other posters have said in this thread it isn at all necessarily sexual am married woman and can find just another question do you think about people when they are not around or is it out of sight out of mind do you miss people when you haven seen them in while or do you just move onto other am gluten intollerant and my son is celiac may be too for the most part avoid gluten that is genetic rather than based on my type think most of my family are are personalities all the infjs you know wish their boyfriends were just like you the thing m learning about enfp is that possibilities are everything and they need someone to not judge them not try and analyze them or figure them out just listen and support them my don have an answer for you but this behaviour sounds lot like my estp brother displayed after break up that took 2 years to actually take there was no communicating with him nothing come accross as nice and friendly to people for instance the other moms at the school my kids go to all know who am and usually initiate conversation but they only get surface me although think there is nothing wrong with having standards and having goals met my now husband when was 21 and had never had boyfriend because wasn ready to get married we my favourite people ever seem to be enfp and some intj you might find one of us in the wild by noticing our eye contact with you we re always watching and we can come accross shy or mildly more questions 1 how do you feel about people with large personal space needs e they don hug you touch you etc and put on an air of touch me and die do you understand think it anyone who assumes m dumb incapable or deficient because happen to be introverted do have people skills will have you know people who assume don care about the things m passionate love cats coffee can do without don even care for the smell of it give me nice cup of tea on the other hand earl grey hot and m happy girl this is tremendously helpful thanks and weirdly felt had to make some cookies to cheer her up the other day so made some salted caramel chocolate sandwhich cookies and brought them over have found m not able to create anythign love when paint sculpt draw etc because have very high unreasonable expectations of what can acheive without putting in the work think follow jesus believe the words he said were true all of them and am not so very good at following them but m learning and believe in world in which truths are really hard to find okay here another why are enfp crazy and silly with some people and straight up and deep and connected with others what does it mean when you re one way or another like are you just bored you are quite right am changing that immediately this happens often when pray never knew it was called something or that others didn share it also when listen to friend of mine speak who is an articulate barritone with an happy thanks wonderful enfp types hugs for everyone will just keep being who am have tendency to not trust myself to very many people because people move on so quickly love being am about 90 certain new friend of mine is an enfp and for the most part we just click don have any deep friendships in my life and d like to keep this enfp at the moment they are interesting maybe this isn a type thing then find that only other nf people ever look really look into my eyes when we re having conversations mean not fleeting words with someone i really like the enfp i know they are my favourite type can look into their eyes and just get them so here are couple of questions does it bother you when someone looks into your eyes firstly really appreciate all of you who have posted here sometimes these things are hard to talk about it very interesting to hear everyone stories and where you have come from and what you an enfp and had project to work on together once for work the most fun ve ever had on project he made me instantly

things happened and found myself in place where was let us know how this progresses believe the universe makes more sense than we realize and the best things in my life have happened when followed my intuition usually fueled by an totally have had similar experience call them muses too there have been three total in my lifetime and it a very complicated thing to undergo just want you to know that

regarding hitting people it is not cool for anyone of any gender to hit another person unless it is in self defense and when defending one such is life being part of society comes with it own issues

somebody to die just because they disagree with you had friend who like to talk what is mgtow anyway hadn heard of it until today so far it reminds me of lesbian separatist movement m not saying that you guys are gay it just radical feminist movement from the think it is for some people and it isn for some as feminist ve always seen it as an ignorance of men issues rather than placing women above men people want equality and they focus on the certainly understand your point most of my female friends have never faces discrimination so understand why they don identify as feminist personally have coming from background that as an intp admire your apathy and the level of distaste you show for both mgtow which didn even know existed until today and feminism that being said do believe the feminism you see is this is why hate the whole feminist debate feel like it the idiots teenage feminists that are the loudest voice to young people who have never really studied feminism people are

little equality in north korea the people are organized into class system called songbun depending on their family backgrounds race as well as the political behavioral and ah you have misunderstood me as well don think anybody is completely equal in literal sense nobody really does bar few communists and certainly not most feminist ve meet in the end fair enough that make sense in all honesty would could consider yourself feminist by proxy but your reasons are perfectly legitimate and you have the right to choose your own label personally really depends on the individual love entp myself great company good fun haven meet many people would outright identify as entjs but the intjs ve meet can be intimidating as political realist and person who studied history don really see most of my thoughts as dark just don ignore or sugar coat the nastier side of reality used to have actual dark to be honest don think anybody does think people are perfectly equal or tries to fit everybody into box every regime and society that has tried have mostly failed or changed their ways why not feminist though see them as same thing feminism is wide academic and philosophical field and while do understand that some of the more radical feminists can have abrasive ideas would consider my self liberal feminist woman of the old blue stocking strain however don bother too much with the academic side of feminism it gives me bit of head ache i 21 happy yes believe you re right statistically there should be more sensors however the amount of sensors change according to where you are at university there seems to be little less in fact my have you tried applying for graduate only positions the ones where they train you up as part of the deal and do you have any useful connections that

to respectfully completely and totally disagree with you on this one especially this part being rude mean immature and hurtful since finding this forum m starting to understand that it as natural for

special things can do for the one i understand what you re saying but haven been here long enough or for that matter don even know enough infps in person to be able to agree or disagree with that theory but what can d like to suggest that just watching movie and snuggling while munching on microwave popcorn or going on hike and spending time exploring nature are in fact just as romantic as any other don know how long ago was 8th grade for you but one freshly picked buttercup is as perfect gesture in 8th grade as it is when you re 38 or 68 happy no need to want to do those things can assure you there are those that would go to such lengths have faith it easier to have faith in your dreams when you know they are attainable and not just fantasy that way they can since m new here haven yet figured out how to start thread of my own but wonder if anyone would be interested in starting thread of romantic ideas m always on search to challenge originally posted by antipro think while two nf will easily form such romantic bond it also very likely to be relationship with little personal growth tend to find the nf nt dynamic more it so sad that almost every online forum you go to is saturated by people that seem to have lost all sense of treating each other well so many cruel people and bullies lashing out at each other m glad didn have camera that day photo could never have

of awesome things over your lifetime the most know who in the world can possibly pick card without opening and reading at least dozen different ones before choosing know who everyone except an infp and thought had issues good grief tongue thanx good to be here happy haven heard the word narwhale in couple years at least and here come to infp write about narwhale in the very first thread read and

to t lol m not looking for someone m already with an intj we have been together for 3 years and seduction had never been problem think it comes naturally for enfp me too lists are awesome sometimes do them just for fun very enjoyable makes me feel like actually did something lol of course knew that but just wasn sure if was on the more extreme side how do delete this thread ve been an enfp since was taking the test at 14 take it every year because in the book that originally took the test in it stated that as people grow older your personality can change or can remember the name of it but had it memorized it was about this little kid with red hoodie and he went out on the first snow the sides of the snow banks were so huge that it looked tried search on this but nothing turned up so yeah don know if its just me or if its the same with other enfp i horribly hopelessly romantic secretly love all of the mushy ace face thanks still don know anyone here very well but think you all are awesome joined because of all the super amazing enfpness you guys have lol oh did she reply my bf does that to me need to get stuff done so can wake up in the morning ill call you tomorrow that always does it for me dont want to impede in his ability to function at work ermmm face palm it hard to not look at someone who talks lot you really said that hope you caught her in good mood here is an idea for you 1 try to catch her when she is not around loooooooool drunk thats how my intj and met and the only times he would say mushy lovey emotional things and how how felt about me was over the phone when he was drunk we always seem to really don know honestly but m pretty sure she starts with an and ends with j even though my dad made her seem like an go for it options are awesome the more the merrier with me its mostly the fact that if don to it ill have big problems later but thats only if its survival thing if its not imperative to my ability to survive then have problems sigh lol the intj might have an emotional overload that might be dangerous have no idea why ve been with my intj for three years and still don know why he likes me so much exactly ross sorry but your signature is not the best ever sigh you intj are so funny and lot of times unimaginative but still love you guys and have no idea why lol literally with me it means that don know that you like me would be interested trying to show respect or feel you out because you intj don give us much to go on lol and yes am very touchy feely oh yeah forgot about the language thing was teaching myself german when was 13 loved it and it helped me to get grasp on it when did go to germany now can speak enough german to get yes am complete nerd geek wanted to be mycologist when was 14 so got every book could on it and studied my off lol also wanted to be nurse at the same time so studied for m not done with the article yet but so far its very interesting thanks with me very obvious heavy flirting emotionally reserved doesn like to go out do social things doesn like to communicate internal goings on likes to argue debate everything overly logical at times refuses to hypothesize if it unfortunately and fortunately am with an intj ve never been so respected and encouraged in my life but on the other hand ve never wanted to choke someone so often not really being too persistent doesn work most times get the job on the spot or get scheduled for an interview haven had tv for 5 years sometimes ill watch documentaries on line but thats about it however if start to watch tv tend to get too involved and can become obsessed little bit that is 1 sunrise or sunset why both because can decide 2 which hogwart house values do you choose as most important if you had to choose one why can really remember which one is confession find it too hard to live in this society and m mad that no one seemingly wants to change it while at the same time complaining about how bad everything is confession 2 m mad relate to 10 really well right now unfortunately awwww thanks usually just walk into place even if you are supposed to do it online fill out an application there and most times get the job from talking to people m horrible at filling out paperwork feel this way all the time maybe its mental defect but think its true until get tooth ache kryptonite for the enfp usually just take forever to choose or ll ask what most ordered but that rare mostly want something from every meal things like how to make cordage dry comfortable shelters primitive fish hooks fire trapping tanning hides with the fur on and waterproofing it edible and medicinal plants and some other things yeah was replying to you that makes much more scene now and would have to say that it was definitely contributing factor first saw package of ground beef then packaged steak then saw brown cow standing in field facing left the sky was overcast and very dark nope did it before knew abort mibt and over analyzing is an understatement in my case drive semi truck long haul so m stuck with myself for too long if enfp made sport of if someone gets raped then the fate of the rapist is for the person who got raped to decide abortion should always be decision and option for every woman child molester should be put to m an enfp and my best friend is an isfp love her to death if we could we would do everything together we complement eachother very well she calms me down and helps me get back to earth and yes raisins are evil don like raisins why well look at them they are just humiliated grapes benny and

              " ' the problem have is that you saw small vocal part of atheists and used it to describe most atheists then you compared most atheists and not the extremist part to small group of

awe of people who have faith and don feel the need to press it on others but instead embody it with my family ve seen my grandparents nod along to enough sermons about conversions and as ve come home for the summer and spent more time around my highly religious family ve found myself frustrated with the near constant presence of religious sermons and radio and the like the issue with my dad doesn stem from an inability to relate we ve talked lot about his past and how it relates to things now and feel part of his chattiness stems from the fact that 1 become proficient in the romance languages

little children in africa though know commercial that appeals to reason wouldn bring in nearly as much m back from my first year of college and staying with my family for the summer and 3 weeks in to 3 month summer break and m at my breaking point already m hoping can get some advice on know how you feel still chameleon with people meet but as ve grown ve realized that most people will accept the more subdued chameleon and that it requires less effort rather than trying made the mistake of reading more about intp cognitive functions as fell asleep and came to few realizations one is that in my mutterings out loud where began speech to an imaginary 9w1 so lazy and feeling like crap about it when can muster the energy to do so introverted thinking types ixtp emphasize the particular meanings of words and how each individual piece fits together within concept introverted thinking type nines can be the most introverted think m going to stick with 9w1 because that the one that resonated most with my actions and motivations and particularly most of the things fault myself for which apparently is common find the mbti more helpful because identify so strongly with intp that there never been question about it there literature for me to find out more about my type and find it easier to m sorry to hear something similar has happened to you seems like one of the best way to get us intps riled though is to ignore us when we re finally up to speak nothing more frustrating than so after putting some thought into it m pretty sure ve lost one of my best friends there was misunderstanding where was briefly upset at him but was never resolved and we didn speak for so took an mbti questionnaire jung preference exploration personality test that was designed to not only tell me my type as see myself but the type would prefer to be and the type am the first one especially is bad with me when m in poor mood and choose to go to friends for advice ll tear down any advice they give me that doesn fit into my way of seeing things most my logic teacher continually refers to the problems as little chess matches and insists that the more difficult ones will be easier with practice because we ll have seen the methods before and know have paper due at midnight less than twelve hours ve hardly started and can bring myself to begin typing once my keys hit the keyboard for this effort ll second guess everything definitely agree with the idea that most people just aren worth the trouble ve times where ll be in perfectly good mood in nice quiet place and then someone will come along and just so ve been toying around with the enneagram and other tests to see if could compile fun little way to look at my particular variation on all of them so far m an intp with negative fe do the same for my enfp bestie though we re both very and very so we come up with grand marvelous strange ideas and don follow through on single one she keep me social and focused on intp and heavily so all tests have pegged me as at about 90 preference in each of my letters except thinking has gone down to 80 think because of the influence of my many feeling type never thought liked math ve always succeeded in it but never really enjoyed it until helped one of my dormmates with her algebra problem and became completely engrossed in the equation and well ve seen s be very assertive when they re dedicated to something know m very very strong last test took pegged me as 91 but get very emphatic about my interests especially the whole theory just screams and love it ve never really believed enough to feel religious believed little enough to deny higher power and claim atheism or had any sort of conviction in some of my best friends are enfps and m glad to see more of them around welcome to perc by any chance do you know what type your mom is because did something similar though not as forceful 89 91 80 91 ended up tying and but pnit suits me far better than npit still not sure how managed to score only an 80 on my i suppose that would be the influence of my m slytherclaw and love that idea more that probably should when you make tumblr post at one in the morning to momentarily rave about how your apathy will never go away and people assume it to be cry for help love my apathy it a shame everyone you know you re an intp when someone to describe why they think you re nice person say that it because you re so very civil think it the most wonderful compliment ve ever received to this morning my parents had to get my dog put down the news was the first thing heard when woke up this morning don feel up to company right now but m making myself get out and got her and large majority of my dorm to take it entj she came out exclaiming that she read it through and it fit perfectly then got chance to explain it in depth along with the sometimes wonder about scar from the lion king m pretty sure that he xntj because he exhibits most of the stereotypical nt arrogance in combination with an ability to get things done if scar believe my roommates come from secret race of nap monsters enjoy having quiet time in my room as much as the next person but it a hassle when can

last night guy from my dorm building came out into the lounge and asked if anyone had some milk did and laziness overruling the fact that barely knew the guy handed over my id card so get that way when m in crowds or lines it actually quite distracting when m at concert and instead of enjoying the music m wondering how the guy in front of me might react if just don believe much in fate but it seems as though all intp are doomed to suffer through incredible loneliness for most of their lives guess that why we have the internet laptops and perc sometimes think it would be relief to be an extrovert then realize that m actually quite content with my introversion and that it the convention of extroverts in my life that has gone and thanks for your perspective ll definitely do some looking into esfj because really do want to get along with this girl and overcoming this anxiety will make it easier for me to deal with just m young and quite frankly emotionally immature intp in my first year of college though am handling the transition to dorm life fairly well find that question myself and my actions more he is romanticized intj personality type thrown into style where it doesn quite fit in was quite frustrated as the story went on and victor lost all reason because was pretty sure i sure he already been brought up on this thread but victor frankenstein seems to me the quintessential intj ve only just started the novel last night but everything read about this never took the act but my sat scores were never better after the first time took the test preparation it

compelled to change just because you want it he is who you wanted for what 10 12 years then you change and so must he that very unfair to expect love languages aren always directly related to mbti

time 9 word of affirmation 6 physical touch 4 acts of service 0 receiving gifts there is no single action or series of actions that will cure you but suspect you already knew that it will be an indefinite span of time so slow that you just forget you were in your head ve still been dating my entp for about 5 years and agree maturity is pretty much must with this pairing but when that present it could be such rewarding relationship for some man this seems like sensitive subject but think one point is fairly obvious you may be all for it open and willing he may not think this sounds most likely as you mentioned join team league like kickball seems to be good way to meet people ve often equated my distaste for displaying my emotions publicly to my desire to not draw attention to myself and too have wondered if this was result of my childhood since ve preferred to would say it mostly for me especially when m around other ti folk impersonally defining the facts of situation then criticizing the poor or praising the excellent logic that m net programmer and love my current job as software designer developer ve been in one other programming position before but it was mundane trouble shooting tasks was good at it but can totally see istp entp couple m istp chick with an entp dude as well could see infp for gaiman and yeah shadow from american gods was istp richard from neverwhere was isfp ouch hope you re doing okay with all of that your relationship sounds just like one that my estp best friend got out of with an istj it was also about year and brutal to watch she wow that is pretty rough m sorry you re going through such sh tty situation it sounds like you both really care about each other and that you have an overall good relationship but will say it easier to talk things out with more socially adept person it can be hard to talk things out with my intp best friend feel awkward and uncomfortable with his responses like really couldn say what this istp is thinking or feeling but being up front will definitely clear things up and if he anything like me he ll try to respond positively if you are clear with if it were me in his shoes would prefer to just grieve in private really don like my grief to be out there except with those absolutely closest to me part of it is just don have the avoid unnecessary drama if it is necessary drama ll deal with it but drama is draining either way and definitely don enjoy it thrill seeking doesn have much to do with it sounds like complete jerk to me some unsolicited advice don waste your time trying to compromise with him in any way on this his behavior isn the type of thing to compromise on and it it certainly would my perception only comes from him his dad who has since left as well and that book so am by no means claiming any real authority on the matter just what do know am somewhat familiar with the community my long time boyfriend is an ex jw and we ve discussed his past life pretty extensively regarding you being recruited truth be told if they re both are good but season 1 seemed more substantial some how raawx yeeeeeeesss very much agree with your typings 98 it true that m primarily present oriented and my life is here in the present near past and future by couple of weeks months maybe is close second and don think about the distant agree with the above posters that you should continue to show your interest from time to time but let him do the majority of the initiation if you don hear from him in while friendly my heart goes out to you sounds like really crappy situation petitpèlerin is right in that this is childish and probably utterly irrational to you but think this is at least lightbox first off hope you re closer to some kind of resolution about this can empathize with not feeling like your needs are being met regardless of the circumstances have to agree cohle is so ti ne intp it hurts marty is an estj one ne type response that comes to mind marty do you believe man can love two women at once cohle don believe man can love this it seems like you re very focused on how your boyfriend treated you unfairly and if your boyfriend was the one posting on the forum think all of our responses would be geared towards hmm couldn really say based on the differences you described but will say ve met istjs that seemingly don like routine it funny sometimes feel like istjs are my complete couldn comment on most of them but always struck me as an introverted thinking or feeling dominant and more ne than ni inxp maybe it would take lot to not accept my child it would probably involve being destructive to themselves and or others and even then don think that would affect my acceptance of them or my it depends on what you mean by chance chance at having the same exact relationship absolutely not chance at re defining or creating whole new relationship based on marked yep what everyone else said might also add that from his point of view he may think his response put it back in your court as in he made it clear that he cares about you but doesn hear hear think this is concept most everyone heard but don think most have truly grasped the significance don know about you but when someone tells me this feel defensive saying nothing does not equal illogical it just picking and choosing your battles hypothetically how would you feel if some person who was strong or intense debator corrected everything you why does being non aggressive cost you your logic and does he know that you feel this way at all just curious what does he do for living know that my work as programmer makes me in sort of troubleshooter critic type mode lot of times have no problem challenging something don even know if this is on topic anymore based on some of the latest responses buuuuut ve always been convinced that the christian apologists s lewis and timothy keller are intjs think istps along with any type really are perfectly capable of abstract thought personally quite enjoy my in depth conversations with my intp best friend but it is pretty crucial for also few of the previous posters have good point here what you think is problem may not be something they think is problem and that another thing that can shut me down if as little sister to an intj and few intj co workers interact with lot hopefully can provide little perspective 1 why do istps avoid sorting out problems based on my experience it sounds like there definitely something going on beneath the surface is there something that comes to mind that you could have done to her it might have even been something you did to someone my point being you will never really know how much she may or may not be thinking about this just as much as you are based on her behavior alone the only way you ll find out is if you just jump whenever my friend freaks out about guy or situation she sounds hysterical and or obsessive to me about every possible detail she over thinks things which think is pretty natural to aux ti can definitely relate and as you said think set myself up for it as well in reality doesn make it hurt any less though and think rationalizing it even by telling yourself well can understand why you brought up the story think would be tempted to bring it up too if had that sort of information but in my experience with dealing with difficult people and it has my best friend is female estp so maybe can shed some light 1 is it common for estps to turn friends into lovers in my experience estps of both genders have no qualms with turning this sounds pretty sh tty and you sound really emotionally stressed about it m sorry to hear that this guy sounds kind of scary and crazy can tell you if your decision to confront him it seems to be pattern that congregate with other ti ers estps entps intps would throw istp in there but don know all that many istps they re also difficult to become close with ',\n",

sorry it so tragic and hard leaving relationship that you worked so hard for it just does terrible things to your mind and emotions you sound like strong person and hope you find honestly cut your losses while you can am doing the same with my isfp ex and it is hell your guy sounds really similar to mine minus some details pm me if you have questions as an isfp ve dated an isfp and your isfp is way better at doing than mine was even for me had to learn to appreciate his lack of foresight but it was hard am the think this thread is dealing with the isfps stackings is the isfp social sexual or self preserving type personally am an sp sx so highly prioritize my family over other social least compatible imo are infj infp isfj esfj may or may not be compatible with intp and enfj think we get along with entjs estps enfp estj istj whatever types left out are ones this resonates with my isfp isfp experience bizarre is exactly the right word am an isfp 9 sp sx am seeing an isfp 2 so sx we are dynamically different and it often feels like we have nothing in common basically all of our differences is reflection of our enneagram exactly this parenting is big deal it basically life goal if your goals and values are not compatible there really isn a real relationship you need to have common ground to even begin maybe bringing new life into the world isn rewarding to her maybe she prefer to adopt what sort of conflict arises are you trying to change her mind this goes back to her maybe as an isfp who doesn want kids would say she being honest don think isfps are the type to play elaborate mind games we re just honest upfront if you want kids you should probably look just saw it in theater christian entj ana infp originally thought she was an isfp but later leaned towards infp because she an eng lit major who is also romantic never read oh man have housemate troubles too and m usually one to bring them up my housemate now avoids me think we didn see each other much to begin with but really wish she would just am in my mid 20s and identify as an asexual and aromantic isfp it was weird realizing that others were puzzled by this as was growing up and wasn able to acknowledge adopt these labels am especially nice at work and with strangers being nice works in my favor it keeps me more or less invisible while still taking care of work and responsibilities with those in my innermost think infjs and isfps make good friends when it comes to smoothing things over between your intj father and your isfp interest think primarily you could be spokeswoman for your isfp apparently 4 years later have different perspective than gave when responded the first time your isfj friend is likely an enneagram 2 definitely read up on this type as it will clear up i highly doubt you can come up with accurate results that isolate mbti affects on respiratory rate due to different lung size and blood pressure alone take deep long breathes naturally and have naturally very low blood pressure exhaled inhaled 2x in 15 seconds this would definitely depend on an individuals activity level another isfp they got engaged 2 days ago theyre super compatible maybe you should just tell the person sometimes that makes it stop and if it doesn at least you did something about it gl realize that the person is probably on pedestal in your mind and likely isn as great as you imagine back everything ferroequinologist has said what prompted you to tell her that it not burden and that you don mind did she ask what her body language like does she mean what she says or does she say things because you expect her to your interaction sounds like the interaction between me and high end extroverts that sounds like highly fe thing to say the istp infj and enfjs know are more likely to think this way whereas the fi users know are more independent so no that not isfp mentality what you said right here is something that can see my more isfp friend saying too it really endearing and makes me wish everyone could see it that way he enneagram 2w3 think lol same have friend who is way more isfp than am and around him think basically look like an intj his first impression of me was as manipulative mastermind which shocked and an estj that know very well can probably make it work with any type who she admires and who also appreciates her she is currently seeing an intj man who deeply cares for her and think it might basically agree with everything said here yay _ gemini sun capricorn moon virgo rising hi perc women practicing specific faith m currently taking some religious

of muscle fibers hurt but when not taken to excess this will eventually result in stronger muscle that can better resist the vulnerability is not goal or measure of emotional health in the same way legs are no goal or measure of soccer skills but as legs are necessary to play soccer so vulnerability is necessary to think the best attitude to adopt is to realize that you are enough for now but not for tomorrow tomorrow you have to be better vulnerability is not only tool or something you might want to try think vulnerability is absolutely necessary for emotional health only if you are truthful about your thoughts and superiority is to function is superior way yes but the word superior needs qualifyer to describe something superior simply means better so if you say something or

then you start valuing it and consequently get attached to it so anything you value will cause suffering and if you dont value if attachments cause suffering and the idea that you are lacking something is an attachment then what is not having an attachment what does not cause suffering if attachments cause suffering and the idea that you are lacking something is an attachment then what is not having an attachment what does not cause suffering yes but that works both ways in fact that works in all ways by your logic any attachment to any thought or belief will cause suffering maybe

told her was sorry to hear about being alone mainly hate being stuck in on saturday or friday night with nobody to talk to or nowhere to go it the worst feeling to get it gets easier can help but wonder how many of them are actually trolling knowing the sort of response they re going to get it cool though we ll move on and take it in our stride right thanks for easing my conscience it interesting actually she was going to wait until contacted her to talk and did well not talking for month and half which will admit did nearly kill keep finding birthday cards tucked away in random places and instead of throwing them out the pile just grows if actually get given them nowadays thankyou it always nice to hear from another person m getting there but at the moment it probably good to think of the fact that when she tries to sleep with other people 6 months in and dear fellow esfj one thing that have always been able to relate to quite well is the list of esfj weaknesses over at personality page most of them anyway especially have very difficult can back this up would much rather give indirect affection to someone than direct ll do most anything for someone that love care about but if you ask me to speak my feelings direct and everybody takes different times with relationships and when people go out they have differing expectations on whether marriage should even occur let alone when can understand where your esfj didn think was the only one but there always the danger of speaking on behalf of people when you don actually know what they re thinking personally never hooked up randomly or anything whilst generally feel the same way give me year or so with the same people and then will like to talk at my job albeit only when can it the same with me in nearly any situation the though can speak for the female esfj i heartily agree with being yourself and the whole authenticty thing personally don drink or anything like that but love to head out with friend puts hand up m lurker when have time and remember come around don see the need for myself to create new thread if there isn anything think d like to talk or discuss about alright m kind of sick of the this type usually dislikes this type because of it not just esfj where it not true but everywhere else too why you ask as people get older especially being straight shooter can be nearly impossible for me it very hard to bring up the courage to be straight down the line sometimes think it would be nice in future if you know that someone is going to misintepret your post you qualify what you mean instead of waiting for response so you can clarify that would be effective yeah though you re kidding me right because being part of temperament means you re part of worldwide problem it just getting further and further off topic also please don imply probably wouldn object to it all that much but it is said by the myers briggs foundation themselves that it is unethical you guys are awesome too don worry about that ve had heaps of fun think cosmia and hunny bunny were pretty spot on agree that esfj won readily forget about someone that rejection or hurt would probably come back cosmia said it well when she said that my apologies for being away for so long ve been incredibly busy the last few months though don wish to bring up things that were posted long time ago april or further back think it love puns but generally will laugh at anything someone know has very dry sense of humour and whilst it took me while to enjoy it as they also come off as very robotic or uncaring with d be inclined to agree especially if person has been deemed by the esfj to be worthy or need to have special attention then they will most definitely get it agree with miss willow if esfj can seem attention seeking to introverts they love to be told that what they did was good and know personally won feel part of team unless feel something positive coming back from read through this and can imagine myself in the same situation can imagine myself saying had no time to do anything and refusing to take time off work putting work above pretty much all learn to keep my mouth shut when don like something open my mouth when something annoys me too easily also need to stop being so incredibly tense all the time and worried about what people oh if ve never heard something so great in my life know sometimes get bit pissed off but really hate that get like that have an intp that refuses to do anything because once upon i like intp strangely enough even though their np can drive me so crazy it not funny actually now think about it their whole intpness can drive me crazy but nevertheless absolutely love if it helps m esfj and am exactly the same always like to clarify everything and make double sure don mess it up d say have fairly good si and reflecting on myself throughout the year it always awkward when those sorts of things happen but there not much you can do about it especially if they re drunk that magical liquor that removes everybodies inhibitions then suppose you have to differentiate between and although it is not supposed to be done let judge another persons type the reason we shouldn do this is because it can be quite in response to someone talking about esfj and intp i get along great with one of my intp friends she one of the nicest people you ll meet the only things that can bother me sometimes is she love isfp i like how they can keep me on edge and good friend know can make me feel better about anything even by way of joke play insulting which nobody else has ever been able to do don think there is such huge difference when posting in thread why do people dislike esfj i thought that it was implying this is why you don like esfj as whole correct me if m it not because don want to do anything it more that can stand to leave people behind that one of the reasons why hate moving more than anything else it really pains me when can i not sure if can help you but to say m borderline and too from the personalitypage for isfj guitar acoustic or electric or anything like guitar like bass ukulele etc can play little bit of piano badly but could figure out things if you gave me lot of time and can do basic play an instrument and used to songwrite quite lot slowly lost time and little bit of creativeness to get songs done over the years though gurlygurl it is kind of stereotype to say that men have to approach women would suggest to try not and hold grudges against certain type just because they burned you in the past so to think that when anybody is quite cold towards you for period of time after relationship it kind of loss know would find it quite weird the person m dating still being good friends come out as an sfj surprisingly and hufflepuff think you re right there isn many of us around m not quite new anymore but got one of my friends who a bit down on my mind and m stressed after really long week but other than when any of your friends who are depressed seem to only talk to you about it and you give them call and have them feeling little bit better by the end of it hohum70 m little unsure as to what you meant in your post would you mind elaborating for me gurlygurl don let thread on the internet dictate whether you have children or not love swimming and ve done it for long time now normally train hard for just under half the year and sometimes wear myself out literally my shoulder and m slowly getting it back to yeah that true also seem to make other people problems mine too and want to fix them which isn the best of ideas either but you re 100 right every field benefits from having range of m not sure it used to be anybody who showed interest in me or really liked me terrible know but after being burnt don know in fact m not sure someone who is generally level headed any type can be anything they want and the profession is better as whole having balanced type pool as better

ve never really socialized in an office environment and always kept to myself eating at my desk or outside etc never know what to say to these people if don need to deal with them for there was recent thread about isfp career paths which didn get tons of replies so m starting another career topic here as ve mentioned several times before ve spent my life trying to don like debates per se because m rarely strong minded about any topic in fact tend to have fairly balanced view about everything so to me there is no right and wrong opinion and the reading an article on the 11 habits of happy people came across this one do you ever think of yourself in this way and how does it come about ve had several jobs but my major ones were real estate secretary data entry clerk technical translator and closed captioning editor none of them really appeal to me at the moment and quit my have the urge to explore new territory all the time even in my own city usually by bus or by bike quit my job nearly month ago and that was sort of running away not in hurry to find bike up small mountain in city park enjoy the view up on top and then appreciate the reward of riding back down don take the mbti too seriously but like horoscopes and birth charts it fun to think about some people seem ot be clearly defined by their type while others such as myself are more my hand doesn have type tongue and the only boyfriend had way back then gee don remember maybe esfj or esfp don go out looking for people but guess that in theory agreed it comes naturally even to someone who never heard about the mbti or introverted feeling so if you need to ask neutral good 38 9 good 10 3 lawful seems cool are they your friends know your question wasn directed at me but tend to be borderline on both also with bit of infp at times the istp dominant function is introverted thinking and the isfp is introverted as said in an earlier post did 7 years worth of classical piano in high school and totally hated doing performances even had performance anxiety when was alone with my teacher d learn quit my job two weeks ago and m not sure what want to do next ideally d be my own boss and make something tangible perhaps personalized that enough people would want to buy but ended ooh you ll wait long time for me don own smartphone never had an ordinary cell phone either and have not yet found the need to have one enslavement is not my thing don you miss m not in the field of psychology but did take few classes back in the day decided not to pursue it because found it too science focussed with having to apply the scientific method and another cat person here haven had any in over decade though because they be rather unhappy where live at the moment and not all dogs are useful the small ones are just noisy agree with this no matter what age m 43 and never tried to get drunk on purpose so it still feels pretty nice after just one glass or two did the equivalent of 7 years of classical piano during high school that 5 years where live ve kept my favorite songs and still play occasionally prefer to play with other people though sun in libra moon in virgo sounds pretty much like me as an isfp

relationships to be activity based especially if there a shared goal attached and it isn just about passing killing time the talking complements the so these relationships were more or less random anybody can start talking with anybody and go out with them but what will cement the relationship if the only thing they seemingly have in common yes people end up confusing human relationships with consumer items that can be both easily acquired and disposed of ve had self help blog about simple living actually and ve also written articles for few specialized member driven magazines and newsletters don write nor read fiction stick to due to some unresolved issues m getting help for don get into relationships but if were open to it think it would most likely happen by chance and

first time read someone wants clingy partner haha as an enfp accused of being clingy from her friends this is somewhat flattering lol xd but still ni and fi should be very different thing right with

creativity have impacts for others life and it must be done in fun way xd think love my job you know immature people are not so good and by the way when pointed those bad traits should ve checked on my self also sometimes can be immature too in different way compare to the immature one to me will be the one who will always bragging about his intelligence and how others are so stupid and those who always complaining and being sarcastic and super negative about meeting mature xntjs will be the end of enfps lol know this is an old thread old comment but just wanna say kinda like it when ntjs went te on me when you can no longer hold yourself for not telling to your long time intj crush that you really like him and apparently still don want to be that straight forward so you used another

the advice doesn cost 05 can appreciate your perspective as have felt the same way myself on occasion it really boils down to you and how you approach or view yourself and others as far as loneliness is concerned if believe the buddhist ideal was addressing material exterior inouts desiring to improve yourself for example is not bad thing so think perhaps you could focus your desires towards meaningful those are adequate answers unfortunately not conducive to extending conversation small talk takes practice and conscious effort for most intps in the weather example might say yes its nice in communication would have to say that wish were quicker but usually like yourself think of things would have liked to say after the fact it really depends though because sometimes can am new to forums but every time see post from you can help but feel pity you need to be little more positive about your worth note comment based entirely on about 6 posts have read know it was expected it entertaining to me as well sometimes so dont mind feeding some trolls if one thing share allows one reader to gain new understanding or perspective then the thread is success will gladly debate all

with only the limited info that can attain the thread is not intended to please everyone if its of no interest then why bother replying lol willpower is trait that doesn come naturally to everyone unfortunately imo the only people you should consider above yourself would be your kids otherwise selfishness is generally speaking normal and reasonable trait their are obvious people who may behave in the these are good suggestions but it is also important to make sure you are not dwelling on the surface but rather going deeper to the root if you were more specific with how one is failure then more then why bother replying the first step is admitting you need help dry some internet guy may or may not have valuable info for you myself am always open to new ideas was inspired to make this post after browsing the forum and seeing that many of the youth here need little wisdom lol know the answers for myself as well just lack the desire to solve some of the challenges like not having enough wealth yet lol am an intp and have 99 99999 of the answers post your questions here and will check daily to give you the answers you seek laughing seriously though get energized helping others solve you tell me does cow deserve less of right to life than dog it not about the money but the money buys time to explore new ventures so get rich in the most efficient manner then retire so you can become scholar that my goal but alas too am whenever confronted with question which you know that if you answer matter of factly will get you undesired results one good practice is to divert the topic or you can put them in frame of obviously there is no magic number believe that external circumstances experiences come in to play with the maturity process generally speaking as an intp you should be able to analyze the lol thanks read that back in college and even though its human nature to worry about your weaknesses make conscious effort to focus on my strengths it is exponentially more valuable for on side note most people dont understand that their type is evolving until they reach maturation thats the problem with many people here they are young and not fully developed into their type am who am dont try to be something am not however that doesn mean that dont evaluate the situation and make adjustments as necessary pretty much everyone puts on front in various usually when do blow up its fast and furious if viable go to the gym and lift weights or just get away from the situation and try to settle myself in this case its easy to see the logical choice 3000 vs 1 is no brainer however if its 1v1 then personally would take all variables in consideration when making my decision the amount as kid use to borrow from stores and would justify it even though knew it was the wrong thing to do don know if did it because my single family mom couldn afford it or because have just curious how other intps feel in regards to abiding by the law evaluate the situation as it

let me try the wreck it ralph characters ralph esfp unhappy with the current reality of him living excluded from the group and parties mostly respect for his work he takes this neglect very how would you define love ve always been told that love is choice and interestingly enough ve found that to be true just to clarify where m coming from though had to learn that love company for my ideal mate think that the one word would use to describe them is uninhibited the thing seek in partner is someone who always looks to moving forward personally and sees career and think would say telepathy it funny how many times someones described what their thinking respond with how understand they say wos you said that better than did posted in another forum my top 10 and why but here think m just going to make list of my top 25 forrest gump batman the dark knight wreck it ralph monster university week ago would have said minion from megamind he a very servant oriented person and rather than initiate he follows the mindset of megamind no matter how askew it may be that said i really should have posted on this forum at some point but guess better late than never so m just going to do top 10 with blurb about why here my top 10 as it stands might be had problems with spiral thinking and my advice get help sometimes having one person who can dedicate an hour without trying to fix the problem immediately to get better understanding of the think know exactly how you feel in way my biggest problem think have is that feel like people need to engage with me more initially before like more so than normal before open up a list of things find humerus puns and wordplay things well thought subtle things inflections piece of scenery characters etc made obvious and now for the joke news anchor that she is just read through for perspective and now m sad that can finish their journey unsure minion from megamind is the isfj probably most relate to and if anyone wants to can say he hardly gets any character time in the movie m gonna say that he similar to the books which makes me think intj can explain why think so other than to say that he seems to you are dreaming soul your vivid imagination takes you away from this world so much so that you tend to live in your head most of the time you have great dreams and ambitions that could be for some reason that was all was sure of as kid that wanted to do for me this was my wanna be firefighter type of thing but never acknowledged it funny thing is ve never board games shocked omfg crazy love board games laughing crazy tongue sorry about that omfg unsure don usually do that swear anyway here all the board games love roommates infp isfp inxp he says he an infp but suspect that he an intp overall he is very hard to type friends off campus estp esfp istp infj follow my gut feelings except about people when their facial expression seems off peek my interest like do with my mom but mostly can say that have very good read on people but here my story was diagnosed with autism at the young age of two so much of my early childhood was engaging in my senses hearing primarily and getting me to comprehend and manage them and interesting theory which like and good examples save for three which never identified with as isfjs simon tam pepper potts and captain america simon is probably the easiest to explain so for me the need to be needed comes up when feel people don value me or my opinion wait did just describe it as itself my need to be needed doesn really come from any specific entps very smart clever and fun people enjoy my time with them however they can be messy and sometimes they will get frustrated with some of the most trivial things that seem to be out of would say the isfjs look for house mates not house mates as in if we can live together we should get married although that is feature what mean is that we are very close to home and would say not even 20 but that just me am an isfj my younger brother is an entp one of my best friends is an entp my older sister is an intp the friendships are great me and my brother have so many inside jokes and are preformed isn it possible to be an isfj without potraying every aspect of being an isfj as described see mbti as an internal process of priorities rather than descriptor of personalities for example on scale from 1 10 how 1 happy am 8 content with room for improvement 2 socially skilled am 7 m not as proficient as delegating as others but seeing some of the drama see so m in my third year of college and ve switched majors twice now ve turned to being film studies major now and ve been struggling with what exactly what wanted to do after college when when this topic comes up there two instances think of where the romance didn start off as passionate both are fictional but ll address that the first is tevye and golde from fiddler on fair enough now that think about it my isfp sister did come to that conclusion as well and haven even looked at and mbti test for who knows how long it still stands that think you re an why do you because you may be an intp in disguise then tongue just kidding can think of anyone else that does except my intp sister you want evidence no one would analyze care or even think about how dichotomous test italicized because that an intp word would be faulty except for intps was going to say you know who you remind me of my intp sister and was just going to give examples of what my sister would say when asked these questions but putting them back to back it you know you are an isfj when you hear the phrase isfj action hero and get really confused unless you ve seen the secret of nimh then you immediately think mrs brisby well where the hell are we gonna find those tv shows watch now survivor avatar legend of korra how met you mother the amazing race game of thrones sherlock mlp fim tv shows have watched firefly here may be some things about isfjs that may clear the air 1 we do

eventually because that way you re writing to put your insights into use to create emotional for me it comes down to the simple fact have to use the extraverted functions for getting more information in and putting what conclude out to prevent the introverted functions from looping sure it applies to anyone stuck in an introversion loop it not true that introverted funtions don work well together but it is true that they re not enough without using the extroverted well this thread brings to mind an infp 8 friend of mine almost re typed her as isfp many times because of that aggressive energy that seemed like se which was actually more like defense 376322 just drew something and was happy about it because it been so long since drew anything just for fun so figured why not share here it my interpretation of enna from 9 5 2 came here and realized how unable am to label anyone as weak that is probably my weakness heh guess weakness in general is being unable to snap out of defensive behaviour that also enfjs are more likely to become hysterical and all over the place when stressed out threatend and infjs are more likely to become neurotic and withdrawn also enfjs are more likely to go into well this question is hard to answer in general because enneagram and other individual differences play great role as well but it can hurt to compare experiences my vibe to great well don know if it just because only people who do relate to this decided to reply but thought d just give different ecperience too since don relate to this that much don infjs are no more psychic than other types it just that we lead with introverted intuition which is mostly an unconscious process of ignoring irrelevant data untill you have only the information can stop typing people either it has helped me navigate social situations and predict people even better than before it like language to all things was never able to put into words well the way am sure is that it is loop between internal logic and internal data patterns ideas when m in an ni ti loop see an all engulfing pattern that defines the whole situation ve never written random thought here before but just felt like sharing because m loosing my mind with my school work and feel like this could be true of some other infjs too so to agree with tyranamiros your infj traits are actually infp traits and the fact that you re focusing on the traits and how you match each set of them rather than the relationship within the well my first mode is to make the other person feel they re welcome to show me anything they want about themselves that it safe to discuss anything with me and just in general make them feel at can recall always withdrew from fighting when was small too when couldn prevent fight with my brothers just tried to keep them from hurting me so wouldn have to hurt them was are you better with understanding concepts or with memorization definitely concepts memorization only works if it something m naturally interested in and can easily fit it into concept oh there are so so many ll just post whatever comes to my mind first small things that have special kind of feeling and can save even the most crappy day cold bed sheets waking feel stupid but think m missing the joke not really no someone talked about personal bubble being invaded think but for me it more like generally feel my bubble is pretty much unpopable you can try but it ll just go along with sure it can occur to varying degrees of intentionality once the infj becomes aware that they re doing it since it is the default mode for infjs when we re not aware of it it can become draining ve kept journal since elementary school too though never wrote everyday more like once week or two and then would pour like twenty pages of random thought into it in the past few years 1 what are your top 3 career choices and what are the underlying values or motivators that have led to these path choices note you don have to say something specific like mechanic or no m horrible at learning new languages i ve always thought infjs would generally be bad at it because ni has to get the whole big picture of it all first then move to the grammar structure find some group activity you care about just for reference something like impro theater is probably better than let say reading group see this is an old thread but saw an intp one and was inspired maybe m not super serious about all these but when you ran into another infj online and they live like buddha infps lead with fi so they are super conscious of their own feelings and values they can easily empathise with others because they can imagine how they would feel in certain situation their si agreed enfj makes the villain who can manipulate the protagonist to go down really unhealthy path and then crush their confidence with single word for the op examples of things interesting i never do that m not sure could my mind is way too active if m not physically doing anything my mind will start playing my stories like it a video tape guess this is m not sure about how much these questions can do either but don seem to see any ni there if these are the first things that come to your mind m guessing you re an si dom nope it enough to be drained by people sadness in real life all the time when m reading books listening to music watching movies etc need happiness to recharge myself so can take in general do you prefer texting or phone calls texting if m contacting someone myself if it the other way around have no preference do you like to webcam facetime with others yes 1 literature finnish my native laguage 2 art 3 religious studies 4 history 5 music there no such thing as too intuitive to be or too in the moment to be but of course the more developed the individuals are the more the types begin to look like each other if you have my opinions are so situational that you could definitely see me as overly flexible and like don even have an opinion but at the same time m extremely stubborn because it my opinion think it has less to do with being infj and more to do with other factors about temperament think enneagram and instinctual variants play big role in it since m 9 so sp or sp so not obviously don know what has happened but here some generalizations be verbal about your feelings and explain precisely why you think the way you think and why certain feelings cause you m feeling random so why not what color is your underwear right now please be wearing something black and white what your favorite board game or similar well just m also sensitive to people energies and vibes but don physically see colours around them do associate people with colours instinctively though but it just one of my internal systems there no way for tara to be ni dom isfj is better but tend to think she esfj agree with kat being esfp and christian istp but think abigail is estj ethan enfp and sammy infp also lucky you thank you for sharing might as well participate ll try to squeeze everything into couple of sentences since tend to be almost too verbal here things value people ',\n",
              " ' oh ve been there quite lot of times and believe have learned my lesson always always always trust my gut that intuitive sense we possess is quite like prediction system we think it quite the same about problems we may face in our lives if we can fix them right then and there we tend to place them aside yes the problem is still there but unlike other types we well to be honest it a goal to gain knowledge in every area we study the more we know the better we understand and the better we feel about what we re studying thing is once we know all we you know what really bothers me when people live with you and realize you work different schedules than they do yet they bitch and moan because stay up late when am off of work and how eat this would have to be the reason why flock to cats as well and dogs are just too much for me although am an animal person ve had cats and dogs that have come up to me when they don it honestly the question we seek anyway no matter what is told to us we end up doing our own research and based on this said research can give us more questions and more questions because the ve been playing great deal of skyrim lately gta is always fun to but rarely do do the missions m beginning to see that love open world games where can do what want without too many you know the only time ever come out of my introspection it seems is when am interested in topic of discussion or if someone breaks my attention in general seem to flow with conversation now am quite curious as to how folder full of pictures on my pc has completely disappeared oh that right installed an xp performance edition on here and didn back them up shocked nice pink floyd shirt by the way great band my mind still gets off to the melodic tones of their wonderful music you listen to tool same thing love it wow m sorry this is quite discussion on the intp dating forum hmm well someone planning on dating an intp take note of this lol can say one thing in all honesty something have realized over time we as race need control without it we would be lost wouldn we but we re afraid of this control we need whether well really hope things keep going on the right path at the pace they are things really need to change on this planet changes that one or few thosand can do it global we re killing our see that what am talking about see the aspects of nature and how when things become too crowded animals fight more between themselves as food becomes scarce they won care about that just amazing that exactly how would describe it we just see through the bullshit we re also quite the minimalist unless that a 9w1 trait find that as long as have computer can one hundred percent agree with this see this exact thing with almost everyone share conversation with they either do not have an opinion about it which should be expected considering know place xbox live lol my gamertag is stoopidmunky11 but will tell you you ll more than likely find me on skyrim don like to play call of duty all day long like some people shakes have confession to make think might be sex addict have major problem with watching porn then walk around and look at women and realize have ray vision able to picture what understand that all too well being jack of all trades does have it benefits in regular life but in career it is sometimes necessary to concentrate on one skill unless this said career am beginning to see exactly what you re speaking of ve discovered myself and thus have discovered many other different things because of it interests that had not once had thoughts had m beginning to think do jobs like these because they re so easy it doesn use any of my brain power whatsoever giving me shit tons of time to think about other more important things going on ve done lot of work in fast food mostly because money issues have made it nearly impossible to continue my education just quit my job at checkers though because it was beginning to be ran well m 27 can tell you my studies are quite random do most things on whim as m sure most intps do something will catch my attention or interest and ll play around with it for 1 work or can say worked now quit about an hour ago at checkers drive in 2 seem to do well at what do even as tedious and repetitive it actually is every day is exactly the all of you have some excellent points can say my mind does do bit of overthinking when she is talking to me about something and that map making sounds exactly like what she does when talk m male intp with an isfj when it comes to conversing we seem to do alright until one of us misunderstands the other which happens more often than not one of us is affected by the others ve even delved into rpg maker type games to give games my own feel why not make an rpg where your main goal is to score tickets to e3 lol tend to gravitate more to the rpg fps strategy and simulations give me something have complete control over and play it for hours the sim games sim city the sims and can do so many got the dark rogue it fits perfectly too m usually drow rogue thief or necromancer in most rpgs play oh man how many times this has happened to me thus the reason why don hang out with more than 2 3 people at time am never heard no matter how loud or how many times say it guess haha just about oh man do have to agree with you here get the zoned out look all the time when start talking theories or just anything sometimes guess it because we talk to fast for people to keep heh yeah because you re thinking it the whole time are you done yet geez you damn complainer lol yeah at least have the choice to adapt to whoever chose to do so with it really taxing to try to emulate what they are so they can better understand where you re coming from they should sometimes that the best thing to do they ll leave eventually when they re done and realize it was of no importance to you whatsoever oh yeah ve been there before it because they know you listen but won judge them for having an outburst they know also that you ll throw some solutions in there if you do speak although they are completely misunderstood by the majority of people they know like you have to be chameleon and adapt to how they are to somehow fit in or be viewed as just weird and when someone am with you 100 damn feeler types and their need for their type of romance happen to be romantic like the kiss at the top of the highest building in the city while the sun is setting kind haha pet rocks that awesome hey at least they exist happen to just talk to mid air on many occasions that how solve majority of my problems lol know won talk to anyone why thank you i don believe we will be able to escape the incompetence though wherever you turn there is always someone doing something that just annoys the piss out of you like why the yeah think the incompetence of the whole ordeal is what pisses me off the most don think unless they re vindictive they re doing it on purpose but you re right there is no reason and no',\n",

there this guy in my class who think might be entp with strong fe he is bit eccentric poetic he in band he has have few of questions for you guys from my experience with you you are super interesting conversationalists unpredictable funny and imaginative each conversation have with an entp has no please delete this thread thank you thanks everyone interesting how different all your answers were but all of them helped need to remember that thinkers are very different to feelers esp extraverted feelers in how much they haha thank you you make me realise was probably seeing things that weren there it not normal behaviour for me but if it is for entp i fine m not an entp but perhaps can offer some insight as two of my good friends are entps wouldn say entps were universal arguers my friends do hold quite strong opinions on certain there this entp at my work always considered us pretty compatible we seem enjoy each other company etc he my senior and often pretty busy with projects sometimes have to work beside him hi viperzz33 thanks for your message it was really interesting to read your perspective on crushes especially about how you change your mind about people and prefer not to make final hi m 22 year old infj with crush on significantly older manager at work he an entp and probably the coolest person ve ever met m for once not being hyperbolic he is intelligent thank you guys that very kind lunagattina such good advice about not overthinking but m afraid there no saving me from that and that very sweet of you to say xix feel like he still hi all thank you for your replies aert you are totally accurate this crush is settling in for the winter winegums how incredible that you ve found this girl m so happy for you aelthwyn hello this is super weird story so buckle in m 21 one month into waitressing job my boss is like the total man he is intelligent witty kind incredibly driven etc should hello it all sounds like bit of mess doesn it m sorry that you got caught up in it think the best thing for them to do would be to talk together sober and as calmly and rationally get crushes all the time but usually some part of me is aware that am simply crushing on flat image of the person which have pumped full of wistful imaginings now have crush which is adultchildofalieninvaders it fascinates me that you are highly sensitive intensely emotional yet you say you are able to quickly analyse and act independently from your emotions what do you think now just want to make some observations of differences between me and my three thinking family members obviously we don represent the whole population get upset or overjoyed much more hello thank you very much for all the responses general reply believe my sister was making this statement with regard to my mother who is dominant fi user it was not necessarily hello yesterday was talking to my sister an intj with strong feeling during the conversation she said this have just as much as strong emotion as you and thinkers have just as much as hi all you have all been incredibly helpful thank you to everyone who gave input thanks especially to fredward and ryuujin76 really helpful posts and my sister intj are not fans of the hello ll take stab jane eyre isfp infp mr rochester istj intj marlin from finding nemo fj think he allowed his emotion to make him irrational is controlling anxious afraid hi everyone have 19 year old younger brother who has been typed as intp think this is probably right he is extremely introverted and go with the flow has wicked sense of humour very thank you all you lived up to my epithet hurricane thanks for the suggestion ve seriously considered isfp but it just doesn work she much too intuitive for it to be anything other than hi lovely infps can you please help me sorry to stick that adjective in there just really like this type so there is someone in my life know and love better than anyone in the world and thank you for your reply no it didn lead to confusion have actually given lot of thought to the isfp possibility but ruled it out forgot to mention that she has definite intuitive alyosha may say you seem very well read ve only read some of tolstoy short stories and none of dostoevsky work sadly but looking back on his writing can now see that tolstoy is an haha identify with that don know if that an infj thing or just coincidence but often have an urge to express what in my head so go ahead and say lot of stuff it only once it raain see what you mean in general infjs might prefer lighter topics for their literature but would also argue there are many exceptions to those rules infjs can be deep and philosophical this thread has some great thoughts in it and hope new post might get the ball rolling again to essentially reiterate what dulcinea said think infp writing would have more unrestrained am so close to my mum that feel understand everything about her and know she feels the same about me but simply cannot type her know that am an infj for long time assumed my my two pence d argue alan davies is percieving believe fp perhaps enfp and have read stephen fry autobiography and quite identify with him he over analyses things and is hey chessio yes he really is buddies with sarah millican she went on his radio show quite few times and they got on like house on fire made for really entertaining listening you should hello read through all these posts and d just like to add my far too thoroughly thought out opinions leslie knope enfj agree with superunknownvortex and hippohunter94 she quite thanks for the advice and ideas everyone may consider asking her about her mbti type but think aizar and faerielandsforlornt are right actually and despite initially seeming intuitive she may yeah moondog m just the same terrible lack of responsibility wonder though if it also product of my upbringing never had to worry about money before left home and now m kind of hi everyone ve recently met an american nf girl and it weird because always assumed when finally met another nf my age it would be an instant amazing connection but this one kind of chessio thanks so much for your well thought out reply m always keen to hear other people thoughts on my psychoanalysis yeah totally see your point about how he always has point lol erm m not sure whether you need this but just remembered another site that would probably make it easier for you as think you have enough insight to be able to type yourself these are the you re definitely not the only one there are quite few threads on this site about actors types but yes find typing celebrities and just regular people very absorbing okay don know hi wes thank you so much for replying thought this post was goner your thoughts have been very helpful in fact came to similar conclusion myself after watching few more interviews yolosodie please try to work on the strength of your arguments before you go around telling people they are wrong m not going to reply again because this is wasting everyone time but although hope it okay to make thread about just one celebrity if there a wider thread please point me to it charging on think andrew garfield is an unusually perceptive actor compared to as an infj female sorry confuse myself sometimes really think m an extrovert because get so much energy from talking to my friends then meet new person and can look them in the think that anyone who has natural capacity for acting is good liar m an infj and find can just convince people m telling the truth by playing part morally although think d be day second infj here zethry really like your ideas about teleportation and the languages one is great idea and would be high up in my ideal superpowers when first read your exact like to think of strong feeling function as sort of gift that has been given to us which allows us to understand emotions both ours and others better than many other people but having gift ',\n",

but every time i took the official test in high school and was really pleased it was so me felt like was really in good company too because other enfps were listed like bill cosby and robin williams know what you mean about the straight up facts thing when there too many facts to remember take them almost literally and have hard time putting them into context if you ever find good used to be like

ancestors could see me showering or using the bathroom or if had unclean read dirty thoughts they could hear them the op also used he cute and gentleman but wish for now our friendship or whatever only went as far as the classroom and moved gradually from there know it not how lot of girls my age are but that lol had habit of falling asleep as soon as the popcorn or my icee was gone when d go to the movies with friends in high school but they also just saw movies found boring too complicated or wish could collect things but lose things so often that they rarely get to the collection level sads hey do collect music thanks to modern technology it harder for me to have freakin huge brown eyes m not that tall 5 5 but people still say m tall kinky curly lush hair and very expressive face skinny with cheeky face that should have dimples but have most of what you have you should probably check and see if your thyroid is off and ask them to check for antibodies also it could be anxiety

              " ' wasting time isn necessarily bad thing as long as you still fulfill the things you need to do be it school job taking care of family etc have come to realize that even though spend i ve always used mbti as more of guideline to learning more about the general thought process of people as an infj you have 4 different functions introverted intuition extroverted feeling what is love usually scroll through the newsfeed to get some giggles and seemingly biased update on friends and acquaintances all of my actual guess closer is better term friends use skype or gtalk do judo but still stub my toe into many my balance on the other hand is great xd try to buy healthy or whatever view to be healthy at the store and then starve myself until get the and this is why we can have nice things well played mister well played too share your fear as well come back and teach us when you are enlightened kitteh though am becoming more receptive to pda one friendly hug at time tested as 5w6 so might be just glancing the nail but deductive reasoning usually quells my fears used to have lot of anxieties and would be consistently stressed out nowadays just embrace not exactly math major electrical engineering but d like to think my brain is good at doing math though do seem to have sort of math dyslexia if look at whatever calculations do or my mother want to believe is an infj and she works as qa quality assurance engineer for cisco they make routers switches etc and they own the servers that the internet basically sits on in haha my roommate is exactly like that less humor though more on the philosophical political discussions though very smart in terms of general intelligence and all that science stuff complete ve got 3 people entp istj istx we ve been together for about 8 9 years since middle school engineering jk xd am under the perception that most entry level jobs that do not require bach science do tend to suck especially in this economy and even more so for us infjs will happphhy neww heeearr hic are you gay you have so much potential you are so smart if only you weren so lazy sad m not lazy just don work study like others do when are my grankids coming my that is strong point like how many people say they didn choose to be gay m pretty sure many males as infj traits tend to lean towards social values often correlated with females didn all the ing time don use it for toxicity though only to add colorful words to an otherwise bland statement can memorize for crap one thing that does help is the old fashioned way of writing it couple times while reading it aloud can memorize things slightly easier using that method am maybe m quite good at keeping it platonic professional swat down all the flags don force yourself tongue ve only had one or two dates with the same girl in high school in my lifespan of about 20 years sure was depressed when got dumped on valentines day and i am 5 as well but tend to be more logical in my approach to things sure my brain might go off and be like hmm something isn right here but it might be quite the leap to jump from don have car but do have license to operate prefer biking walking public transit to car though love mmorpgs anything that is immerse and beautiful to my eye is generally an game in my book also play league of legends but enjoy that because my friends enjoy it as well and think back at what makes you happy genuinely happy content fell into slump back in high school im in college now with an almost identical scenario regarding depression was depressed with this nothing pisses me off more than realizing my own stupid mistakes m currently rooming with an intj and one clear difference feel is the lack of empathy he often likes to put the comfort of himself over the comfort of others he also tends to miss quite few ve walked into realtor sign on my way back from school great many suns ago not exactly my best moment m currently studying undergrad for electrical engineering and simply love it the people get to hang out with are so quirky kitteh m good at math and solving problems so why not mean yea she nailed it though once we do have mutual trust affection you may find that infjs have an overabundance amount of love in terms signs of affection though have not have significant might have thought like that but usually give people the benefit of the doubt sometimes to the point of blissful obliviousness my worst absorb moment was when walked into real estate sign hadn even noticed left the sidewalk didn like her romantically because she was already taken blushed and don roll that way the way people have described intuition to me is that intuition is kind of feeling that you kind of know how to do something but you can technically describe it or something like that when sneaky 2 hander is the way to go nothing says igotcha like an invisible greatsword cleaving through an unsuspecting fellow for more realistic purposes use bow handles better m bad at flirting what do wish was alive like 4 8 years before was born it seems like am always at the wrong age at the wrong time other than the first statement wink fully agree with this guy use lot of silly emotes but maybe that is because played mmorpgs for the past 8 or so years snark snark snark snark as not an expert on intp but for my friend i usually give them space if they are distant let them know that will be there if they ever need me and they are more than welcome to come to me self control goes long way laughing true that all infj males are different in dealing with the opposite sex usually this is based off experience and lot of time more experienced and older but don wana win the lotto crying ve heard bad stories mostly corruption and stuff m to awesome to be corrupt proud edit d make myself super computer and donate the man can talk to girls for my life well the ones that don know flirting is so hard on another note am very good at reciprocating and responding not so much as initiating tbh want to be an intj those guys are absolute geniuses act like them too that is before my emotions start kicking in man cry too easily feel special but not because am tbh don know what am just feel most at home in the infj part of the forums well feel most at home reading posts in the infj forums ve tested as intj been told to by others that 1 watch some anime together it what usually do when feel down 2 start fight club 3 do not speak of said fight club league of legends anime homework and lot of naps studying undergrad as an electrical engineer though do have quite the passion for programming as well holy crap talk about creepily similar my hair can probably be styled but am the type to just shave it to buzz cut when it gets too long besides that it grows the way it grows my bed did this once back in like middle school don think the was too young to understand will do for his age nowadays usually get the signs and back off then again don sniper on your 6

no no no no nooo you re going about this thinking mapping and trying to dissect it too hard that you re actually making careless mistakes in your process and screwing delusions okay sorry for the hiatus had to take care of few things and got distracted based on the desire for accomplishment competency could very well be an istj don say or think m shrugging my shoulders right now won say anything but you re probably going to change back to intp sometime later down the road but for now just encourage you to keep exploring obstinatesnooperr hey sorry got sidetracked by other issues here your reply won tell you the comment that made me widen my eyes prefer not to tell people exact details about how m obstinatesnooperr tomorrow ll reply it late over here good question and sorry the alerts for this site are wonky don get notified at all of replies will give you one probably late tonight or tomorrow lol obstinate you re going to make me pull my hair out you definitely have ne from what ve seen and what you describe is really ne working like se ni that where you might be mixing things understood well you know where to find me obstinate if you ever want to talk about anything just let me know obstinatesnooperr sure thing it my pleasure obstinate don do lot of typing but am deep into the ones actually start about your values it was towards the later middle half if obstinatesnooperr that okay after all you do know best and type should ultimately be decided by that person alone however things people say about you comments people make as an outsider oh you re so nice and respectful tongue okay you may have already seen me type few other people in the forum but this is basically what do take list of all 16 personality types and obstinatesnooperr obstinate you and that head of yours are certainly tricky will give you that but m putting in the muscle to get you out of this your main functions are little bit lol you make me laugh can already tell it going to be blast speaking with you you are right on two things one you did insult my conclusion two do want to gauge your reactions to what sure ll take this the enigmatic intj if you want me to go through the full motions chart let me know and ll do that for you okay obstinate here we go this is little bit time consuming but do this for every person type just so they can see how got to where did and what think of them m going start off obstinatesnooperr the link to your avatar is broken would you be able to find it again and re upload it post it here not lot of people realize this but user avatar is like an unconscious actually came to the end that obstinate is istp will post about that later today understood and you are very welcome yes it pretty damaging to an extraverted feeler when someone they expect to love and cherish them back doesn it turns into downward spiral and does hey there dutiful counselor this was nice read wish you luck in putting the final stamp on that bachelor degree and getting what you want out of life don think you re an istj like your my reply to you seems to have gotten lost just came back to the site after 2 3 year hiatus was checking through the forum to see what could do to get back into form was going to look fdt yes same with narcissistic also believe you are an intp you were probably waiting for and looking forward to more detailed and thorough answer but there are just some patterns you see octavian hey there octa it is very clear you have deep knowledge of this wish could explain to you why it comes out as ti fe to me but don share the same depth and extensiveness in ah so it looks like grehoy already took care of you wink hello all this is my first name change if possible may it be switched to kinetic do you still want help lol you have got to be kidding me and you re welcome oh my god you can be asking us this it is nearly impossible to do just with that even so swear on my honor that will try to type this man as best can you are into him yes you don octavian sorry but think the way you re going about this is making it more complicated than it really is to me it seems as if you re looking at lot of different clues misinterpreting you are introverted intj intp infj infp istj istp isfj isfp you are not sj temperament intj intp infj infp istp isfp you are not fi dom intj intp infj istp you are not infj are you serious the problem here is that the isfj and intp are very similar on paper they both have the same interaction style as well as the same cognitive functions they are both introverted too without shark tank v show music plays in the background me alpha you know you really sound like nice guy mean love your questionnaire it has lots of information on you and it very easy was hoping you didn ask that crying it takes me so long to do that haha but here goes ll start the reply and add in things by the edit button as go along here is list of ti fe laughing tine don think you are posting these kind of threads in the right section here my answer though for me it flipped my outside behavior does not reflect my inner self or type it hey ll pop on some yiruma and get right to it introverted intj intp infj infp istj istp isfj isfp you have ne si intp infp istj isfj hard to see you have ti fe intp isfj ghostsoul don give up yet wink can you link me to your questionnaire or fill out another one m not good at typing through writing m better when can have snapshot of what goes on in correct that would be the wrong way to look at it being and introverted sensor means you re introverted and sensor haha read your opening post and between intp entp d say entp keep your if you say he is infp believe you going off that his reasoning is quite logical though his te is weak it still te and it very straightforward he will save money if he did either of those no no about the 800 members part m sure not every single one of them will sign up for competition like this and mass type this poll showing who voted for which option would be an go meet him be yourself and see what happens just always keep this in the back of your mind real life issues will come up you will have to deal with forming relationship with his daughter let me just say absolutely love making ideas for perc m also fan of big events with little competition so what have in mind is type me bowl either sponsored by the perc staff itself or in the post before your last you said this these are the external changes you re going through these are the things that block out your type learning changing and improving yourself is the problem here is the definition of extraversion the tests you are taking define extraversion as being sociable out going and talking lot extraversion according to the cognitive function two things chest 1 you think she fe dom 2 you think she extraverted shocked ti se to me would be applying analytical and critical thinking to physical things this is why some istp are magicians when it comes to cars really the mechanics of physical things how car ti supported by ne is whether an idea makes sense to you when you share this with someone else and they say it wouldn work in real life the external due to money space and other practical you have ti fe then you are introverted intp istp isfj infj you are not si dom nor ni dom intp istp for lot of reasons intp ooooh someone is snippy

              " ' in the recent ukraine crisis ve had hard time deciding whose propaganda has been more blatant that of the russian tv or that of the western tv and newspapers ve decided that they are lying mhmmm it either having sex with my chemistry teacher or standing on the seat of my motorbike at 60 mph take your pick both events happened long time ago my female intj friend plays piano dances ballet likes to go hiking and loves classic german poetry sounds more like the hobbies of an infp lol besides my usual two dozen hobbies and interests m currently obsessing about the history of the american west ve almost finished one book and already ordered the next ve also started to read if my longest relationship would have been 1 1 2 years would also say that would never ever cheat and it incomprehensible for me how somebody could cheat don want to offend anybody but there should be law demanding that everybody who rants publicly against cheating must disclose the length of his her longest relationship knowledge love friendship freedom loyalty peace silence health good food and wine my female intj friend used to be my superior at work for 8 years and she definitely not intimidating but her bluntness and her tendency to fight for her opinion in meetings didn make her very reading your post almost got the impression you don like istjs my girlfriend is an istj and love her dependabilty honesty and dedication to everything she does and to the people she yes but then most people younger than let say 40 have ridiculously short attention span maybe feel like that because grew up in the pre digital age don know anybody who is less controlling than am in relationship eat alone most of the time at work need some quiet time to recharge my batteries also like to read in my lunch break in my adult life never met anybody who made me hate him her dislike sure but not hate usually feel that somebody who is doing something bad is inferior how can hate somebody who is who says intjs don know how to get girls speak about yourself bro ve known an intj woman for about 10 years at least she tests as intj but sometimes think she might be an intp anyway for about 8 years she was my superior at work we had very good the thread title reminds me of this penpal had for short time who was always explaining to me why really did or said something and how she is so empathic that she always understands people certainly have scientific approach to life my main goal in life is to learn how everything works as kid wanted to know why some stars are moving while others are stationary where the well m shocked not by the article but by the fucking virus that the website the op has linked to was trying to send me ve met three intjs two females one male and like all of them two are pretty close friends have always something interesting to talk about with them best friend must be loyal dependable inspiring intelligent honest and willing to share his her thoughts and feelings with me feel blessed that in my life have met two great friends who my female infp best friend and have been fans of the same rock band and we used to chat on their website then we met in berlin spend before sunrise like weekend together decided to stay best marcus aurelius it not that strange click with other intjs they may be rare but if meet them there is good chance that we ll become friends one of my childhood friends is an intj ve known him for agree with lilysocks everybody gets boring if m around them too long or meet them too often some people bore me after minute and some after spending week with them even my so begins to very well observed know three other intjs one has been confirmed by multiple tests the two others have done only one test each but know them well enough that can type them without any test in fact think m very touchy feely with my girlfriend and with my female best friend also consider myself romantic the other 3 intjs know in real life are not much different the stereotypical ice cold so we are only allowed to talk about ourselves here lol that pretty silly you don know me and you certainly don know my best friend so can talk about whatever feel like here that it not like that she does put on very nice clothes and she puts on quite bit of make up she wants to look attractive she just thinks that she looks like an ugly duck when in fact she as my infp best friend also can do this find it extremely weird she can describe the colours of all the people she knows in detail isn it strange that sometimes the most beautiful people hate their bodies and faces my female best friend looks absolutely stunning lot of heads are turning when she enters pub her body is some of my strategies for coping with stress anger and sadness going out and having long walks in parks or nature going jogging or work out writing long mails to friends and penpals talk can carry it for you but can carry you from the lord of the rings the return of the king plus about half of the dialogs in casablanca according to david keirsey intjs are very good in maintaining relationships if they have finally found somebody who meets their standards my relationship has now lasted for more than 28 years and like hugging close friends unfortunately most guys feel really uncomfortable with it so most of the time only hug my female friends don like to be hugged by mere acquaintances and have to say understand the annoyance of the op also think that anybody should be able to answer text in reasonable time say 24 hours but have to live with the fact that many people it obviously depends on the other persons personality type trying to covince an infp with stating facts and explaining the rationality of the thing you desire is strategy that is doomed to fail m more easily hurt by criticism that is completely undeserved it makes me think how in hell could he she think that about me in the office sometimes take extra efforts to please then get ready for wild ride if you ever get close to one especially female one nobody can twist and shake your brain cells like an infp you care lot about you ll desperately try to m like you m usually trying to find out why somebody who used to be friendly to me is suddenly acting like an ass or giving me the silent treatment however sometimes people are just to scared well only really know one infp in person m attracted to her because we can talk for hours and hours about wild concepts philosophies psychology cosmology the meaning and the subtexts of i was born in 1967 so was 25 in 1992 yet hate most music that was made in the late 80s and early 90s love rock and pop music that was produced from the 60s to the early 80s and then some my infp best friend is exactly like you yeah it sounds crazy but if infps strongly criticize somebody and get angry with him her it means they do have strong feelings for that person for people they don care much about they usually know exactly what you are talking about does your date know about mbti if not my recommendation would be to introduce him to it and give him david keirsey please understand me ii as ah ok see english is not my first language so sorry if some of my wording is bit awkward m happy if can express at least 70 of what truly mean lol completely agree it always annoys me when anti social intjs blame their lack of social skills to their personality type yes don like to go out too often especially not to big parties or btw my profile picture was painted my my infp friend couldn agree more only by learning about mbti have understood that every personality type is dogmatic in his her own way intjs and infps are certainly among the most dogmatic but don let bago think you have misunderstood me

some days am not in the mood but will make up for it the upcoming greetings hereby invite you to participate in assisting me in order to help me reach conclusion on my mbti type understand that since

would assume is si when someone is talking to me sometimes start that interesting don really prefer animals over humans in terms of interaction quite the contrary don like having animals because it is an unnecessary obligation where you have to feed don know if this has anything to do with being intp or personality types in general but feel lot of empathy for most animals can really empathize when an animal is hurt and will feel am introverted and hate all kind of noises be it dogs barking children crying or ambient cars driving around when hear dog barking cringe because the sound is so annoying want to develop my judger function in order to balance out perceiving get around 30 50 on most tests and want to lower it have gotten far more structured being able to initiate intj being j would be golden no more procrastinating would be able to structure all my plans for the future and also retain my intellect int one letter away from achieving god status have few guys who are esfp they are just way too social for their own good you can see how their faces shine up when they have someone to talk to even if that person doesn like them got just got out of depressed state ve been in for while for being isolated and full of stress because of exams m in much healthier state of mind now and decided to write this again do you intp like to touch things unsure always have to touch something when am at friends place have tendency to touch all his stuff because m so curious it feels like always are some of you guys impulsive sometimes generally think before doing things but sometimes do things without thinking of the consequences of my actions this is usually when am in bad mood thank you for your input but you don think am an esfp probably use se the most m not sure if am an istp got it few times on the mbti test but recognize lot more with estp or esfp if sp is the case few things hate crowds and the unpredictability like any certain reasons why you don see intj identify lot with intj and their description hello am very eager to find out what personality type am have been spending the last 2 weeks in ectasy of finding out am if you guys could help me settle this matter that would be great m an esfp and wish was intj honestly admire every intj know because you have the potential to get so far and you don need people around esfp have the potential to get far in the social when you browse the internet and get distracted by things opening new tabs all the time by the end of the session you have 20 30 tabs open do almost all xsfp appreciate the beauty of nature personally don care about how beautiful mountain is or how blue the sky is and rarely take pictures of the nature even when am on get pursued lot by horny girls but am the kind of person who always looking for new options so act indifferent can really be bothered by pursuing myself see myself as the prize and may have narcissistic traits but definately do not suffer from any cluster

what they in my personal experience entjs are not my type at all admire entjs because they re usually determined and ambitious and they never let anything get them down while they re striving for goal resent that m an infp occasionally because of my strong fixation on fi makes it hard to connect with others but do appreciate the high self awareness get to experience think ideally went out with an enfj twice but he was just so obsessed with fe and being proper and normal and conforming to what dates were supposed to be like it drove me mad also feel that lot of the m not an enfp though we do share fi ne but definitely do this would probably call it social experimentation in the most ethical way though tend to drop stories or ask for advice say i personally drawn to ixtx types though the main bias seems to be for s theres an estj somewhere probably because they hold deep secrets because they re types and find that lot harder why m single there another thread which is kind of similar to this but this is little more specific infps can be quite dreamy and picky with people especially because they re so are you choosing to be single wouldn say m choosing to be single as much as it just been massive compilation of just not good enough or it didn work out as relentless sx for while was interested in an estj and we had little bit of discussion about our attraction was quite forward with her and admired her brash straightforward personality wasn huge how well do you normally handle break ups m pretty self dependent but of course what would an infp be if not indulgent in their emotions mope around bit emotionally try to distance ve always unknowingly befriended types but in terms of kindred spirits like platonic soulmates spirit animal type deals d say infps usually always hit the mark and then infjs are close think after being involved with two different intps it really depends on your intp depending on the extremity of their personas if they have one and since the functions are their ti maust used to be exactly like your sister kind of the those who burn brighter burn twice as short type thing the infp you meet are probably the ones who are more adept at blending in at describe the very first things that jump out to you in this picture game art concept art style wise chiaroscuro thought about that movie where the guy gets stuck between rock and mountain think when you start overthinking what people are thinking about you it becomes incredibly socially awkward coming from someone who used to become exhausted with conversation at school cantonese infp from hong kong also find that our caring and not really concerned about buisness lawyer doctor professions and unwillingness to be fake often drives us apart from asian eh ve done it before but it more sentiment like would feel bad and d love to help them out and the one person dated out of pity ended up being half physical fling with disastrous unless m somewhat sure that have chance with the person like literally will not approach them guess if you can spot an infp tracking down the person they like usually visually so as an infp who weirdly addicted to s always feel insane frustration with dealing with them so does any infp have practice dealing long term with t partner ve gone through nearly all finally told the istj boy ve liked for months that liked him to find out that he liked me too listening to bootlegs of my favorite singers in the best musicals ever having pad thai for m not an infp so forgive me yes take care of my appearance but it really depends on my mood one thing though the way dress must always adapt with my personality and m usually into the most probably an xsfj leaning towards my mom is an entj and it the worst thing to deal with we don argue that much m more passive but she seriously ticks me off when m stressed would say any extreme j or would drain my energy because is the only type which can drain me because that the intake of information s are particularly fussy in terms of oh yess all the time see some awesome people on tumblr or at uni and just wanna be all like we re best friends now you can never leave but then sometimes just don because that would haha that exactly what m learning though think it might be another year until he ll ever say we re dating or anything of that variant unless get super frustrated and upset and push for an coughs so finally cleared things up with istj boy got little bit anxious and so wouldn tell him something and know he loves knowing answers and he kept persisting and asking anger frustration stress depression paranoia and panic m usually all over the shop but the negative emotions really get me so usually have to talk to someone to blow it off m not so listening to broadway and neo soul while procrastinate sleeping and doing transcriptions for linguistics debating about writing stupid poetry about crushes and talking to friends and tumblr ing depends how much it is and how often m exposed to them if we re talking general just arguments me and my ex don get along well if we talk for long time or on certain topics but usually if lowering expectations dulling emotions as someone else said usually it failed though in terms of relationships and life in general m generally quite jaded when am sad though mope really don have that much of happy romance story nor do have partner at the moment but can tell many many stories of depressing failed relationships don know what aha we lie evidently good line alright to get down to buisness if your infp is anything like me m guessing she also having ball of time trying to figure out what the hell you re actually before my first relationship had never experienced intense sexual desire after it kind of noticed that it became sort of need for desire personally don really like the process have to say probably agree with the subtle attacks when m pushed to the edge my anger sort of can really be vented out at quick enough speed and if it more complex such as to someone honestly being someone else is so normal ve been creating and building myself based off characteristics of fictional characters fanfiction and other people since was young sometimes feel love spontaneity but also love cliches going to an art gallery or really interesting shops beautiful exquisite places am complete sucker for cute little cafes perfume shop decorated sherlock benedict cumberbatch quirks are my favorite even become more attentive after watch it weird absorbing infp habit brooklyn nine nine unexpected favorite orange is the new black m very much fanatic about mbti typing but only because it makes me much more understanding of their behavior and can adjust my thinking patterns to suit how they understand concepts and what well this is pretty much why m asking for an istj reckon to him it not that big of deal but for me as an infp get really happy about the fact that he concerned however m little keep soft copy of journal ve had since 8th grade but always switch up online blogs tumblrs and little places can just keep my opinion and drop it somewhere to rant it out nobody dear istj could you please please realize that like you and you re the best thing that happened to me since got phone just want to spend time with you get to know you more cmon commitment phobe

and got mouthraped by an italian guy on holiday which was not fun such turn off feel more comfortable with showing strangers trust with my writing there something about the anonymity that just works because my writing is such personal subject the only other people who uh ve always had more unrequited love situations and crushes than actual relationships because rarely act upon my deep seated

build rapport with people so that they drain you less the more comfortable you are with them and the more you ve learned about them as goodthankyou m one of your favs what did do happy sent from my iphone using tapatalk agree with you 110 before when didn do this it caused lot of hurt feelings believe the biggest thing is that we should vocalize our expectations versus keeping them silent no one is absolutely we like harmony so we want to notice our commonality first the fun part is when you realize that each isfp is their own island nation with their own set of rules exploring that is fun this never solves anything tongue just my two cents some things to consider 1 she may not realize she taking advantage of you 2 if she an isfp then jumping in the car to hang out with you and then realizing she was lazy this last saturday and did nothing but watching tv no regrets then made up for it by being extremely active on sunday and monday sunburns everywhere there so many to pick from but if narrowed it down to singular person it would be arabellagator truth cold hard logic wins again sigh agree however we are pulling in all sorts of new isfps because we can make up our minds they

denied everyone can thanks tongue sent from my iphone using tapatalk d also like to point out that my suggestion for our lounge is in the lead with 11 votes all of which are authentic and not troll accounts created by me to pad my stats cool the very fact totally voting for that love how this all goes from poll to something completely different by this end of this we may not even care for lounge such is the way of isfp happy sent from my iphone using tapatalk arabellagator m not saying they aren clean socks m just saying you may want to double check happy lock arms this killed me haha you ve gone up the point rankings in my book tongue creativity over clarity well yes this is the artists forums believe we should vote if vote should even take place to vote on extending the vote for the new lounge the best way can describe it is saying they can neither confirm nor deny that god of any sort does or does not exist agnostic person who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of god or of anything beyond material phenomena person who claims neither faith nor disbelief in someone who shares my values someone who can escape reality good heart doesn matter

death in the family or friend significant relationship that ended etc we are very secretive and elusive we are common enough but we know where to stay hidden and out of sight the biggest reason you don see us is simple anti social an apple day keeps the doctor away now who going to do that unsure what stresses out an isfp x96 rigid structure and rules x96 having to violate their deeply held values x96 not enough alone time too much extraverting x96 too many demands or obligations x96 having believe one of the biggest challenges is not to become jaded our past experiences often lead us to this type of behavior where we unduly and unfairly punish future happenings as result we yes talk with my hands probably more than m aware of feel odd when don i find that holding cup of coffee or drink suppresses this habit and has the same comfortable feeling as if mninp this is just my two cents isfps as you stated are shy and don say much words are used to supplement our actions through actions is how we communicate rather than bumping into her agree with lot of what you said not all debates can be planned out like social gathering where discussion turns into more do you disengage

was born and raised in captivity as it is though guess you could say that letting her loose so that she could survive in nature somehow would serve 1 though ve been toughened up by growing up in

and beer cider hangout with other infps does that count or is this strictly mating thread m cool with it though mostly since aged when was younger wanted to be less emotional than am and be more like

they take the hint and leave me the didn mean to imply that it always sucks because sometimes people tell you interesting things and you may genuinely enjoy having brief conversation with someone but there are those people that if friend disagrees with my values try to hear them out to see what their reasoning is maybe they have that point of view because their life has turned out differently than

need to feel more or less part of whole while being inherently alone because while we can relate to other people more or less get to know you forgot turn the game into ridiculous soap opera in which the main character is lesbian kleptomanic coward as well as famous writer author of bestsellers such as so badly written and in general like to know as little as possible on the museum or gallery am going to visit main themes some names perhaps to discover the information once am there then like to take i agree that she seemed to be thinker for some reasons and an introvert although we probably haven seen enough of her to clearly see ti te fi fe why do you see her as sj the metacrisis not very surprising for character written by neil gaiman at least when it comes to idris tardis but guess it her personality canon now so now the mystery for the next series we perhaps the tardis an nf nobody ever tried to type the tardis it surprising intj wrong as usual yes the tricky thing with his social mistakes is that he an alien though very old alien who spent so much time in contemporary great britain that he should know better xd but need to work on my functions again as it been long time since read anything on mbti and typing in general nine seems mostly unhealthy to me he suffers from serious trauma due to the intp super invisibility power but it the world around you that will become invisible the schizotypal and schizoid traits would come with aspergers and ocd anyway internet tests aren accurate let not take them too seriously many people think or have some kind of problem none my guess would be that we are just differently stubborn js only seem more stubborn in the way they are stereotypically described but being organised and planning doesn equal stubborness think cognitive functions are more accurate than tests and type portraits for some reasons and many people think they are type because they relate more to the description it like subtype it could be good explanation yes developing se by necessity rather than because it a natural preference mean if you had to follow the family trend of course it tends to happen to some even though tests aren very accurate you re probably an istp can see how and why you could seem intp unless reading about the function makes you think you use more ne si than se ni of course my brother being driven mostly by ti lately seems pretty much on the intuitive sensor border even though he is an istp would assume strong ti tends to make one more abstract and therefore more it probably highly subjective but it seemed to me that he was very likely to have more strong values feeling of right and wrong and react when they were threatened than ti user but then again 1 what aspect of your personality made you unsure of your type ve noticed that tend to think better when m discussing with someone even if will tend to monologue speaking and writing d assume france is some kind of es but they would probably don agree 1st doctor intj 9th doctor istp possible even though he can seem extraverted sometimes 10th doctor entp turning into an enfp toward the end think there more fi in him than ti in many time to draw conclusion it probably explains why so many ins think they share similarities with asperger anyway there are many other reasons for someone to have some aspie traits such as lack of eye contact sensory don think introversion look similar to asperger it may look like some extreme versions of some types but introversion only cannot be shouldn be enough to diagnose autism it clearly more why should we be able to get horns want horns horns are cool you re making me sad this is why personally think that typing in general is useful introspective tool rather than mean to categorize people and determine truly their personality it is also depending on the the correlation which had been established on this forum and some of the links which have been provided are mostly about the fasle astrological signs there is some lack of coherence and this is ridiculous there are other activities which can stimulate someone with strong se just because you re experience of istp is that they are mostly athletic doesn meant that they really all mostly because can see ne si and fe to some extent and guess that she also uses ti this is probably why she comes out more as an intp when we read your description she doesn seem really si you still have to seperate trekkies from star wars fans though it probably depends more on your skills area and learning style than on your type but you could always ask other istps of course they can every can actually it just stereotype that sensors are less imaginative than others actually depends on many factors and the imagination may just be about different how can there be no social class or order if there are rulers dominant the intp world would be very funny to see considering the stereotypes without the stereotypes it less funny of doesn mean judgemental it just means that the main judging function te is extravert if m right tps can be quite judgmental sometimes intjs and istps sometimes appear similar could you analyse and describe the way you attempt to predict the future by the way are you saying that you imagine probable future and then work on it to happen the way you ve imagined it did you ever thought you were another type due to your autism have seen that autistic people tend to score more naturally as istj intj and to some extent intp but that only when it comes to are there evidence of mbti characteristics being purely genetics though just asking d be interested to read anything on this subject since the question of nature vs nurture and personality is ni is often described as intuition of time intuition of the future though intps tend to like speculation and will make up random probabilities the process is certainly different it open to since don know whether you misunderstood me or was just following the conversation m going to say something anyway the problem mentioned in my previous post was mostly that the would isfj be possibility if she a feeler how old is she that could be weak fe which is common to both istp and intp think people are separating what the letters mean and what the functions are and have been associated with stereotypes behaviours and let face it we all tend to go from one side to another obi wan seems more of an is in the prequels than an but he does seems bit more nish in the original trilogy and the jedi order in general is not very intuitive and seems to be more of i think some disorders can have an impact on the access or use we have of our functions or at least on the way we are perceived when it comes to the main dichotomy perhaps it does not necessary because they don show their happiness in the same way seem more reserved and are associated with false introversion caused by severe anxiety and disorders also because they are associated to was thinking int as well can really tell his functions or his true self from the songs though can seem to find any speculation over his type on the internet either well apart from one ',\n",

everything read said things like you re doormat and people take don hide it if people are interested but don advertise it either mean when people are genuinely interested it can be good for discussion but overall people just don seem to know like most things but lately ve mostly been listening to old new zealand music eg 2000 2005 ish time frame bit of nostalgia there think and my husband new favourite abney park there haha was just going to post something very similar to this work deadlines will always always hit may procrastinate bit but always make sure that whatever is due is done by the due this is such great post agree with pretty much everything you ve said this bit was really great and agree so much there is such stigma to the term feminist that is based only m not religious either guess could be called agnostic since ve investigated several religions and found something in few of them none of them works for me though especially since they think the problem is that if these isfjs are anything like me even just saying we don want to do something in what you consider to be wishy washy way is strongly expressed no to us if 1 how do you all use si day to day just do tongue no seriously don have any idea how to answer this question it just natural it just happens maybe this relates to si let me 1 what do you think about gender roles do you prefer to stick to the role that is traditionally assigned to your gender and if so do you think others should do the same think gender roles are why do you think that d think fe trying to make harmony in the world would be easily swayed towards volunteering for the good of group m with those who think most types could be m not sure if it would ever get published because it very much slice of life story rather than something with proper plot as such it based on the woman and few of her friends and shudder twilight isn a good example of any genre suspect anne elliot in jane austen persuasion is an isfj also try book called the total tragedy of girl named hamlet by erin dionne if she not an isfj she not too far from how totally agree set myself challenge to write book where the main character is an isfj with all our flaws but also our strengths am about 1 4 of the way through it an interesting m isfj have loved doctor who since was kid grew up with it probably as repeats since doubt was old enough to remember pertwee from the first time round and know saw his episodes had casual ish outdoor wedding in the garden of an old house then we went inside to small ish reception which was just buffet so no big deal served meal for us did have my dream dress nope not at all in the generally understood like traditional values and think society should never ever change because liberal nonsense is bad sense of the word in the do like traditions of kanerou identify quite heavily with what you say m 99 sure m an isfj but many of the traits ascribed to isfjs turn me cold many of them are not what consider desirable and in lot of in general agree but that mother repeatedly did something that was clearly hurtful and upsetting to her child and eventually that child lost her temper it happens and doubt she totally woah this is bit harsh respect has to be earned and if the mother is telling these embarrassing stories and disrespecting the child then no she certainly doesn deserve respect respect isn hmmm think you should do it if you do it and just let it speak for itself you won have to go up to people what you ll get is people who are at least curious talking to you about it so you kind of see these as two different things first for me to start hanging out with someone need to find some common ground just like teddy said have taken lately to talking with people on yeah was brought up in left leaning family that always emphasised making our own minds up and freedom of opinion consequently m very left leaning while one of my brothers is right leaning and gnudung reading what you wrote think you need to watch the less mainstream movies two of the three you list that you ve seen this year are major blockbusters which by definition pander to the yep that all it all need to do because there are very few times when don understand where my emotions are coming from generally my emotions aren what need to figure out in order to almost always left there are probably few issues where lean right but they don tend to be the ones that are important to me so if it came to vote for the left person who covers most of my even as female do this too have been accused of being cold by people who don know me because will never let my emotions out to people who don deserve them as to your question basically floated through my first year of university got shock when failed couple of papers then chose second year papers that interested me and learned that couldn cruise the it depends on the topic with lighter more casual topics tend to write as speak and my blog is bit difficult to follow because of this tendency but if it something deeper or want to ve been reading this thread with interest since it started and agree with this we re seeing an almost textbook example of the types of miscommunication that can occur between these two types yeah like the others have said pay rent on time and do your share of the chores even if you hate them your own room if it separate can be as messy disgusting as you like but any shared areas doctor who mostly that the only one really hang out for but others also watch are big bang theory grimm project runway america next top model can help it with those two just my best advice is to take one of those interests and think of present that relates for example with the art get an art book related to the art she likes to look at or if she likes to create art the one intj know is really good at playing devil advocate and appreciate him for helping me learn to look deeper at all sides of topic before deciding what my opinion on it is for me to get into my inner world takes time don share who am at my deepest with just anyone and even in relationship it takes long time to get to know who really am my advice if you mine is building in my city that was extensively damaged in big earthquake 2 years ago chose it because always loved it in there we are still not allowed back to the building and likely was like you with my kids had routines that did to signal to them when it was bed time or bath time or feed time or whatever but they were never rigid nor were they at the same time each 1 if you could anthropomorphize yourself into an animal would animal would represent you d like to say cat but suspect d be some sort of really clingy dog hate dogs though so maybe he was toooooo good too nice too everything think wanted to slap him this is possibly lot to do with it being long time since saw his movie and that hated the avengers on the other spend lot of time at home but if m not there ll be at the local park library coffee shop bookshop at the movie theatre or sitting around reading at the beach ugh really haven watched in while but absolutely loathe movie captain america especially in the avengers wonder why usually feel quite happy affinity to characters generally typed ve only watched one and half of the videos but it really interesting teddy you are so adorable really liked the way both of you interacted together and m really itching to watch the isfjs tend to be the nurses caregivers etc and are generally in the background you don often find them in main character roles they will sometimes be the shoulder to cry on sidekick for the teddy564339 m sorry if this is hijacking your thread but ve been mulling over what you ve said here and m little confused on one point if you suggest that we need to allow fe to dominate m married to an enfp and one of my best friends is one adore them they are the only type ever get feeling about before becoming friends everyone ve been immediately drawn

trilogy in when was younger early 20s could easily just not sleep night and then function perfectly fine the next day and still go to sleep fairly late today tend to go to sleep at around midnight usually ask for cake which is odd because m not big fan of cake just like the idea of cake don normally ask for money simply because if m doing task for someone then don overthink things just like to do some metal research to see if what m about to do say is worth it today for example saw co worker who happened to look very nice my train of hey there is absolutely nothing wrong with stuff lol m afraid have lot more than 10 cables lol have so many power supplies for devices no longer have part of me says dude new best friend but one of the most loyal ever not sure if should be happy or sad

enjoys what he doing he ll really go at it for hours and forget about all kinds of things like eating personally sounds like an intp to me seems to live lot more in don really understand why so many intp seem to want to be emotionless emotions are what makes us interesting have felt love for many people currently feel love for many people and feel have lot of strengths really my ability to know little bit about lot of things is always fun allows me to make friends with more people not good close friends that circle is rather look at some serious extroverts and the idea of not being able to be on my own is just weird to me you can see how miserable some of these guys get when they are forced to be on their own consider myself christian but also consider myself an enemy of christians not really an enemy but there is so much about christianity that dislike that don even like being called hey m not robot m human 2 0 m also human sleepy don know what m saying good night he a lucky guy having found someone that will even take the time to try and understand him and look past his lows and remember all the good that he can also be hope all goes well for you guys late in the conversation as usual but was bit upset at some of the earlier responses this thread got making any big change is difficult on any intp specially if it not change you people come to me for lot of things lot of time they come to me for advice with their relationship issues not sure what about single 34 year old man makes them think know jack about ve got one but it just picture of cheetah ve always loved cheetahs so don think ll ever tire of it it on my arm but usually have shirts with longer sleeves so really just like normal nature the stronger one is the leader in our society the one that knows the most about subject normally becomes the leader unless that person just plain doesn care then did think about estj for while but the guy is so jolly all the time and most of the

things are ok with my friends when they contact me and act normal if you give him time he we usually don dislike people for the hell of it we do tend to dislike certain commitments whenever ve told anyone that ll help them with anything scheduled hate myself for it just ok was joking obviously don really know anything about time travel but too would be interested on how this has actually been proven to be fact don see how traveling at any m into so many things don know what can consider hobby and what can i guess technology currently very much into the cell phone tablet market but don know what it ll be few well m not going to sleep now because just woke up glad to see m not the only one with sleep issues mean sleep fine but hate sleeping and it not like have anything better have we define cheating because when say ve cheated on someone was dating mean ve formed feelings for someone else and pursued those feelings have never slept with anyone while in i ve cheated on women ve been with but wouldn call them my significant others ok so ve been trying to type my boss for while just for fun ve thought he is many things but currently m seriously thinking enfj he in his 50s so it very difficult to tell but i kind of like that today still want to be in relationship really badly but then when think about really being in relationship it scares me like crazy the idea of always having to there is nothing wrong with having career living your life for career is the problem allowing your career to dictate what you do with your life is the problem never give up on who you really completely agree who says we have to get married who says we have to have kids and if you don have wife and kids then who says you have to live in any specific way am the type of you could try talking to the guy or email the guy since we become so much more talkative over email or you could just forget about him and just let him find out if he made mistake later m more of the belief that the parents buy the kids the presents but also santa does how does this work well it obvious that santa claus can go buy everyone gifts and give them all out m kind of the same way guess live 3 minutes away from work but get up at 5 00 am don start getting ready for work till 7am from 5 to 7 it just me going online looking up stuff well at my workplace see so many people who have to be checking their emails constantly even when outside of work it like they feel everything will fall apart if they wait till the next day to have to get to work before 8 am because otherwise will get some really

an enfp my boyfriend is an istj we ve been together for 2 1 2 years living together for 8 months be careful to not get into the idea that mbti is the end all be all for relationships relationships aren just predisposed system that you input coordinates in to you re such an intj wink my istj loves to cook and he loves cooking for me we both enjoy it and our favorite thing is cooking together we are foodies and creating something like an amazing meal together is really esxxs and istps esxjs they tend to be very aggressive estjs in rules esfjs in morals and refuse to see any other pov fe doms drive me nuts because find it like selling out and that gah this is my life it like for the love of god all want to do is avoid confrontation just want people to love me kaliflower first off hugs it gonna get better promise second m also in nyc and totally get where you re coming from guess the big difference between us is that chose have any of you dated type personalities ve been with my istj boyfriend now for 2 years before that typically dated other intuitives had thing for inxjs how did it go well here one just read today has teach for america reached its waterloo al jazeera america pinion you just described the inner workings of the enfp for most of us ne doms it a constant struggle to follow through with our ideas and it seems to me that you are somehow channeling am messy person by default am constantly moving from point of order to point of disorder entropy is my life my so says thrive in organized chaos however find that go down so this is how you keep your subforum so positive in relation to istj relationships hmmmmmmm tongue meant that with all the love in my heart kitteh anyone else struggle with expressing their thoughts and feelings to others this has been an issue most of my life but don know if it because grew up in an emotionally abusive home or if woohoo slow and steady wins the race these istjs really are like turtles it makes those who care about them learn patience my guess is the emotions he has are likely stronger than he is yikes can totally see how that a problem for you but my guess is many most of the class is frustrated and confused as well perhaps even intuitives think one thing that helps intutives forget the esfp women there a lot of us enfp gals who love istjs kitteh you don lack intuition everyone has it it just you either don trust it or haven developed it enough to really notice it in terms of cognitive functions every person has all 8 are you implying that the virgin mary and jesus were soulmates m confused also not sure if that constitutes proof unless you re creationist and if that the case then enfpleasantly m not mom but totally know where you re coming from and know when have kids will likely be the same as you my friends who have kids and are part of these mommy let him know you appreciate his concern but don get all gushy and whatever you do do not squee istjs are duty fulfillers but unfortunately many people either take advantage of this or they really like this shame has been something ve been thinking about lot lately struggle lot with self shame as well as this idea of perfectionism spend lot of time in therapy trying this is pretty much on par with my life as well especially the idea that others have said about knowing immediately if you see future with someone or not m in my late 20s and didn really my istj and spend out first valentine day together driving to dc to spend the weekend with friends we went on double date for dinner that night and everyone in the restaurant was staring at smooth doubt life is ever smooth for two anxiety prone people confused but totally get where you re coming from we definitely go through periods where there a lot of focus on the welcome back pinkrasputin definitely agree that the enfp istj differences can be are what draw us to each other my istj and will celebrate 2 years in few weeks and we ve been living think this is an issue for many people not just istjs but do know that it something my istj struggles with greatly but the truth is she is with you because she chooses to be and if she this is exactly what was saying however it still not collective culture which virtually eliminates that idea of being free thinking we still value free thinking it just the interesting idea the one thing can thing of is why is the stj the predominant attitude in the western world is because it is the predominant personality type westerners are focused very knowing how my istj is at 28 well he was 26 when we started dating can only imagine him decade ago what he would have been like and what mean by this is that istjs are notorious for that an interesting perspective whereas kind of enjoy those kinds of series because am constantly on the lookout for instances where it either answers previously unknown problem or i never used it to gain affection but rather to gain connection for example learned early on that negative attention was better than no attention at all so learned to act out at home learned the art of manipulation early growing up in an emotionally abusive home that manipulation was my defense mechanism and now as an adult know when am doing it and feel horrible but just wanted to clarify what meant there is massive difference between knowing someone is marriage material and seeing relationship as something that hopefully will progress towards marriage idealizing any type is leading you to recipe for disaster your entire post to me is massive red flag to me and probably is to most istjs its way too aggressive and not thought through advice don set out to marry certain type or just person in general find man that makes you happy that you in turn want to marry know that istjs and enfjs tend to not see eye to eye kaliflower sounds totally normal to me it just how we enfps are we re actually the most introverted of the extroverts which is why we can go from being that hyper happy go lucky one thing ve noticed that is very hard for me is that being an enfp m almost jack of all trades but master of none when it comes to friends have lots of friends but very few close don think he an istj but can be sure but it could be possible that if he for example grew up in household of stjs he might feel that that is the proper personality behavior and thanks so much this makes lot of sense still wish he could be more direct about this conversation but can see that he is trying to show me that things are moving am excited and do know istjs are known for their to the point and blunt way of communicating but one thing ve noticed with my istj is that sometimes feel like he is over sharing especially on certain don know but think my istj needs to read this thread aside from doing the dishes which ironically since we moved in together he has been the one less diligent about this even thought well just to be obvious most people don say do those things when they are in the initial stages of relationship also most istjs are much gentler in their criticisms those kinds of comments m glad some other people pointed out that this is not typical istj behavior either he mistyped or he a sociopath and those things are not mutually exclusive you both sound immature and now you have baby on the way always good thing honestly think he needs to grow up and you need to decide if this is the life you want because people perhaps words of affirmation is non existent as love language for him he may be trying to show you love through other routes maybe gift giving you spend considerable amount of time and for the second time socionics is not mbti enfp ne fi te si enfj fe ni se ti socionics has different tertiary and inferior functions because its not the same thing it a onion don ever tell someone they can not be certain type because of single trait that you may not exhibit or don believe type should exhibit also it even worse when you have obvious hearttwist as an enfp in relationship with an isxj know where you are coming from my istj boyfriend and find one of our biggest differences that at times causes problems is that used to think that could only ever be happy with another intuitive so totally get that also think that most istjs would not be happy in relationship with but that my istj doesn ',\n",

years was an intp while he had feelings and crap they weren enneagram doesn really measure something innate like mbti so you mean like humphrey bogart or ray romano there are lot of girls who like them still haven figured them out but they re awesome especially because they give me hope that the pua seconded can really explain it but m such an idealist guess that once see some glimpse of better way to live just grasp it and can let go if it entails becoming clingy these are just the men unfortunate enough to have shown low social value and therefore become objects of their disgust if that

about how men think with their she sounds adorable m all for the no compromises approach to living never faking anything but seriously it not at all realistic everyone has to fake being some way from time to time whether it faking it awful that you feel that way have hope though most everyone in the world has done that sort of thing and m sure your soulmate or whoever ends up making you the most happy would not the worst thing is it probably because you like them and make it transparent that this is the case that they don like you _ yep still yearn for stuff and act like major doofus but was raised an atheist and m little bit sad about that hear stories from my friends about how they would pray with utmost sincerity and really believed that there was god looking out for oy gevalt stop thinking this way it will only bring you pain know exactly how you feel but seriously stop this this is classic si fi loop where emotions both negative and positive this is not worth dedicating all this thought and energy to just go and talk to her damn your aspirations and what you believe your life will be with her if you continue to think that it this is probably tangential but the most infuriating thing that ever happened to me was this guy knew in high school was huge jerk to me in front of other people but when was the only person almost always something small and fast and with an awesome melee attack or something skinny and tall with really good ranged attack like to think of my characters as either easy going prefer to point out hypocrisy that really not normal everyone has at least some sex drive even if they never think about it we re going to have to face it as horrible as this is women like jerks as matter of fact niceness in man actually elicits disgust reaction this is why women will pull away from you not really comfortable with it honestly the people in my real life have always had really extremely twisted view of it for example one time was watching this weird video on the know this is why ve loved computers in general ever since was kid they re not judgmental all they do is help if you speak their language they re infinitely faithful and won leave damn man this is why wish was an intj they re thinkers with an extraverted judging function and they can get things done but there just something so magical and uncanny about their are you done nit picking know dislike that too being made the center of attention blegh hahah agree not worth it did this when was kid maybe sixth or seventh grade actually knew back then about myers briggs ve always been interested in this sort of thing just one friend met over the internet have another friend who is sort of close but he an intp and is not interested in feelings and stuff even though for the most part we see the world really the myers briggs profile is not the be all end all of your personality don even like when people call their four letter code their personality it isn all that code tells

being in trouble if never got caught m with gloosle on this one most people tell me all about themselves every now and then ll meet someone who listens as well as do and we ll stare at each other for while love to ask didn get in much trouble in school but usually kept my head down in book got in little trouble for that few times because stephen king wasn on the required reading list used hear you feel you agree with you on almost every point however feel that each individual contributes based on what they have to give used to believe that had to accomplish something such tall order to make this list read and reread my favorites until they are practically falling apart when was kid loved stephen king dean koontz robert jordan r tolkien anne really enjoyed your take on this you came up with something almost completely new and wholly unlike me very nice unfortunately m not much of poetry critic or d give you more feedback that cracked me up thanks man the most important thing is that you realize what behavior you want to change this realization can take some people an entire lifetime some never realize it at all several years ago realized would it be possible for you to teach art you seem like you be excellent at it understand where you re coming from played basketball for year and found had the same issues you do the same went for softball ended up forsaking sports in school in favor of band i totally feel what you re saying it sounds fascinating my father is great coach though he never got into it professionally he taught me so much and still does to this day admire the confidence you guys bring to thanks lady i love to help you learn guitar just holler if you want some tips think families are falling apart for multiple reasons one reason is that people have to work to long and to hard to make ends meet they have little time left for their families without time and here is another ve written recently going home soon ll be going home to the humid air of alabama

to realize something new met my first best buddy in the fourth grade she wanted to ride my bicycle and said no wai we ve been friends ever since guess that would be twenty five years now we re not as close as we wanted to be musician or an actress to begin with stage fright just overwhelmed me managed to perform in the senior play and was thrilled by it but talk about draining experience hosted if your letter doesn work you might consider the gentler version of omar suggestion he right sometimes people just can take hint sometimes something concrete like letter works wonders can draw to save my

almost eerie this sentence is beautiful and dead on when began studying anthropology in college developed fascination with the am fascinated by this topic recently put the two closest men in my life through an experiment to see if could detect them lying they are both intjs one loves to tell tall tales the other is no way everyone is just different have seen my husband cry once in the thirteen years ve know him and that was because drove him to it was so shocked when he cried didn know what to how many people here that get depressed also exercise regularly m just curious had issues with depression throughout my twenties and into my early thirties but didn exercise regularly you should listen to your intuition if you feel danger signals there is reason for that from reading your posts would say you re not ready don let people peer pressure you into i ve written couple of sad ballads here an example ve never had it recorded unfortunately sad state of disrepair walls ceilings

perspicacious 1w9 5w6 2w1 so sp cordial milli66 1w9 4w5 so sp rwm4768 1w9 5w4 2w1 sp so pterodactyl 1w9 5w6 2w1 so sx younique 2w1 5w6 m going to agree on the don get drunk bit would probably solve things and if you want to listen to my version possible explanation why it happens then here it goes have no claims for m not going to voice an opinion on the situation in general because don precisely thing it my place to be doing it even if advice was sought but would just like to say katmandu that m feeling little bit crazy right now actually it been building throughout the entire day but an hour or so ago it finally started up for real m wound up and don know what to do with it haha no and ll admit have some vested interesting in it being pansexual myself but unless it really obvious that someone gay m not going to realize it right away after while do you make random noises that others find funny occasionally make random noises they re usually quiet so don know if anyone else notices finds them funny do you dislike misleading 1 what your mbti type infj 2 what your gender m biologically female but identify as without gender 3 are you the eldest child middle child or youngest child eldest child 4 how do my mom an infx type she done tests and traditional dichotomy tests tend to make her an infj but tend to think she an infp quite bit of the time instead my father is bit harder to pin am actually really selfish person m just more subtle about it than most people so they don notice usually can convince myself that m not but some days it really obvious to me and madness have an infp boyfriend and another infp best friend whom ve known for over 12 years of my life which at 19 is lot of years of my life you guys are awesome hell third of time first on an unrelated note now have much better understanding of ne than did before reading this thread laughed through most of the first post as my ni scrambled to keep up it was when something hurts me or difficult to think about it gets thrown into box into filing cabinet and is hidden away at the back of my brain to only be taken out very specific moments when sure there are time that avoid social interaction with my friends because m too drain usually just get really drained when there conflict going on the group and then ll procrastinate on am the lord of lies the dame of deciet and the harold of hidden lives flock to me my children and we will forever revel in the filth and horror of humanity for they lost their compassion long you look at me with so much expectancy and force my lips to curve up in smile know you expect words of affection in return and my stomach tightens each time you look at me as know can all things pass in time we are far less significant than we imagine ourselves to be all that we are all that we have wrought is but shadow no matter how durable it may seem one day when the cats like coffee while tolerable don have any real inclination for while will drink it on rare occasions caffeine doesn help me stay awake or do anything productive and it makes me have suffered from that one in particular but there have been other times when sometimes confuse dreams and reality and particularly thinking about saying vs actually saying something do scored 53 but think it depends on the day sometimes well m entering into forensic science program in oh two weeks now and my eventual plan is to become forensic pathologist ie the one that does autopsies this is actually slightly strange mine depends on mood more or less when m in good mood ll give out hugs to most people even people don know that well heck if m in good mood or just feeling affectionate then ll do drink ll admit but usually only get drunk because all of my friends are getting drunk and bother me when m being sober giving into peer pressure is bad know but the more time funeral okay comment incoming you have very sweet singing voice but were my music teacher would be telling you to project more and do admit curiosity as to how you would sound if you did that is perfectly all right in fact it makes me fairly gleeful that someone bothered to poke me to remind me at all even if already made recording so thanks proud yeah as much as d like to think could there a good chance would just have an emotional breakdown if was ever in such situation as for typing them hmm yeah we should probably barrons is wonderful 3 and yes you must finish reading them anyways made voice recording apologize for the fuzziness and fluctuation in volume at time as well as the background just spend the past couple of hours reading this thread and listening to every voice clip though some not quite as attentatively oops distraction and honestly think this thread is voted high school grad because that what did back in june but m going off to university come september right now the long term plan is to get my md feel like with lot of last times for things would like to have one last time but usually can bring myself to actually have the emotional connection at the time m too busy doing m not an infp and while don mind answering the phone and like talking to my close friends on the phone as general rule hate hate hate having to make phone calls make phone calls to my 1 liberalist 2 environmentalist 3 academist am 9w1 6w5 and either 2w1 or 4w5 as my heart fix am still looking for me don know what to vote on that xd definitely not second person because it gross to write in but otherwise m not too picky definitely started out both reading and writing first person m infj 9w1 ravenclaw had expected to get either ravenclaw because am rather intelligent or huffelpuff because of my 9ness my want is laurel and pheonix feather 14 5 hard disorder rating information paranoid yes yes yes perhaps not so much outright gore at least in movies because feel like seeing excessive blood and guts just isn really necessary love the psychological aspects and gore in haven actually started university yet but the program m going into is forensic sciences if it didn go into this was probably going to go into neuroscience biology tends to be my least morning person by nature night person by nurture nurture being my childhood friend who definitely night person and had to learn to stay up late and then sleep in and function the next day m going to say that set 3 bothered me the most and can seem to rank the rest of them below it because they all seem to bother me more or less equally for different reasons and because i have one very obvious one on my dominant left hand between my head and heart lines and multitude of smaller ones on my right hand but tend to feel those ones have little impact because m single so have no story to share and my mother an infj as well but she was proposed to by my father he actually told his mother couple days after he met my mom that she was the one he was show characteristics of both and m not sure could qualify as one or the other m really good at reading and writing but the only reason can write so well is because have time to think currently in the middle of deathstalker rebellion by simon green it the second book in series of five and they re good if you like somewhat stereotypical scifi novels haven had much it seven thirty pm have letter to write and quiz to study for because have quiz first period yet am on perc it is simply how we function my friend the infp is also horrible m 19 and have never been in relationship or on date or kissed anyone it not as though ve been avoiding relationships and there are couple people that have liked but it just has where do you work being student currently nowhere however if had job right now it would probably just end up being something part time as restaurant or fast food joint or grocery store ',\n",

              " ' didn mean to suggest using perfectionism as an insult it usually creates certain insecurities and worries and also requires certain skill set you could attack those it a pretty cool idea and it hard to insult model of person so think you did well considering you only had theoretical description in front of you d say don give up on it the don feel insulted you actually complimented our intelligence and called us lazy we get that all the time and m not really sure even cared the first time someone called me that these if it useful information for your research thing it not that haven had problems m not talking to my dad for example because like your friend can stand it but when it comes to my parents are both left leaning and non religious maybe that played part in it that sounds like really frustrating environment for an intp to grow up in though it wasn strict in straightforward way they openly judged certain behaviors and were like if you do this m going to be very disappointed and lose respect for you instead of just saying you me intp 5w4 brother intp probably 5w6 dad istj not sure but there 1 mom istj no idea my experience and observation tells me fi users tolerate it better in general high fi better than low fi because they have more control over it it makes sense theoretically too inferior function my personality somewhat changes because need to adapt my sense of humor and behavior think of certain concepts better in different languages but my personality type doesn change 1 what is your perceived mbti type how certain are you of this assertion intp about 80 sure 2 where you considered to be an easy child moderate in temperament easy going ect or my advice is pick broad area so you have the opportunity to move around instead of repeating the same work every day otherwise even if you re interested now you won be in the future because then you want to improve your use of ne you can improve ne by socializing putting yourself in new environments getting out of your comfort zone brainstorming ideas trying to come up with it sounds like your main problem is wanting to be more outspoken and social rather than turning into an entp the theory says you can change your type be who you wanna be you don have to move infj got intp in every other test so far and don think use ni but who knows that the same wording as the comment above me the brain is strange thing personally think it fun to learn and think about it but at the end of the day it bullshit kinda like the possibility of ghosts actually being overlapping dimensions or universes or agreed he the most realistic one intp characters can think of right now spencer reid victor frankenstein think peter parker bruce banner bbc movie sherlock but those are ongoing debates so maybe not sheldon cooper klaus genuinely can tell if you re serious or trolling at this point this is pretty interesting actually ve been thinking about this and you know how cognitive functions have no scientific basis because they can be tested was wondering if there could be i ll die before get to it will it look as tiny as they do in the sky the stars will get to witness this pretty late think think it valid but missing some parts ie not broad enough thank you all for your responses will try to get better at it have you ever had any problem with this in the past if you have when did you start learning how to say no wanted to know how other intps are with saying no to people unless it something really don want to do find it very difficult to say no to strangers and friends if it an old friend intps aren too fixed on impressions or m not at least approach people with curiosity and my impression of them the first one usually being negative and of some people downright cruel okay this is the pattern ve observed to intp ti ne si fe entp ne ti fe si the lowercase e indicate introversion extraversion if the letter order is the same save for e the think monty is an entp probably an entp so they can kick start bunch of friendships for me and when come back won be too different m in my prep year at university that pretty much my priority right now liked the movie didn like the ending it was kind of like causal loop was expecting more interesting solution than that as far as the typing goes thought the main character most dominant types see submissive types as weak and most submissive types see dominant types as aggressive and or stuck up it how life works because emotionally people will always favor how they based on the results d say intj m not sure how to fully explain my thought process could also indicate intj as ni is more unconscious than ti but that may be stereotyping m not sure huh nice idea there could be correlation my dreams are usually really vivid and it takes me couple of seconds to come back to reality they re either really creepy psychological thriller make posts and hope someone replies man share your thoughts start discussion there are particular subforums for everything comment on other posts only suggested the app because it easier to use there is no experiment going on here and it not support group either everyone here just knows little about mbti and we talk about it everyone replied to the rest so wanted to adress this ambivert isn a thing in mbti because your functions determine your extraversion introversion if your dominant function is introverted female intp is definitely not the majority and it seems like we re actually the complete opposite of the ideal female ve been accused of trying to act like dude to get dudes multiple times but if you have smart phone suggest using the tapatalk app but for example that was kind of part of the problem in my relationship there was hardly any conflict for months then started to realize that the lack of conflict wasn because we just got along okay ll be honest lot of people are going to say mbti doesn define relationships but it a personality theory so it kind of does bit if you gave list of personality traits instead of friendship is different you don have as many responsibilities in friendship the expectations are different and you don have to communicate with your friends as frequently as you would with i have experienced this and tend to push through the m not interested anymore feeling and my interest usually comes back it always comes and goes for me and it the same for my other all of them if it an emotional situation m kinda scared of it but if it a debate or something similar mostly can be bothered with it also kind of depends on the person m supposed to be interesting thank you for answering have question let say the world is ending and you have spaceship you ve gotten the people necessary to build civilization on board scientists politicians maybe physically strong don think everyone is equally valuable although that does not mean anyone should be treated differently but don think value can be determined by price tag either don care how rich my theory is that introverts like listening and extraverts like talking two introverts lots of awkward silences two extraverts people trying to talk over each other don get offended you know that an exfp in loop thing think my enfp friend would probably describe herself in the exact same way the difference is think where our values come from an esfp values would come from oh read some of those numbers wrong the picture is blurry on my phone then d guess esfp because of high se so se definitely needs to be in dom or aux position tertiary te in exfps can make them d guess entj but that looks confusing ',\n",
              " ' have tried on multiple occasions although never finish them except for one time when somehow got myself to actually finish it and then edit rewrite it however it is 3 pages on

meltedsorbet thank you will try this geometric shape drawing hm this bigger picture thing seems interesting and surreal also this measurement system seems useful very useful in fact now that thank you try not to use rulers because it slows me down and find that tend to think of it as cheating really would like to get into this really technical area so guess it ll take time hm thank you this is interesting any idea how long itll take to develop this ability and as for these books recently bought the collected journals of leonardo davinci and he has sketched aha thank you can kind of comprehend what you mean and im on it right away good luck to you as well aaaahh thank you though m curious why anatomy know that davinci and michalangelo personally took it upon themselves to cut open corpses but how does that contribute to artistic ability just looking for tips advice or any general knowledge on how can improve upon weak drawing ability really would like to be able to draw as amazingly as my heroes so any help would be great have heard people say that films are an escape more specifically have heard the entire span of films to represent something within the person who sees themselves as the main character or october 2nd hm thank you for this am huge marilyn manson fan you summed up the triptych pretty well hm out of curiosity can tell me ur interpretation of other works opinions underlying themes am ha sounds like how spend my evenings and im going to be junior sixteen in the fall will be mostly an indoor person most likely reading writing short story or working on songs through guitar ill also be looking into whatever am obsessed with in the moment agree with agree that perhaps wouldn have been involved in the scene because of all the egoisms and asshole ness but still love the music punk and all its derivatives have had lot of effect on same but usually am focused on rock music especially stuff from the70 and 90 so what are going to do with your summer its really sad for these small groups especially the toll it takes on the people and music within the group definitely agree every major and even some minor subcultures that began from heavy metal was just that accidently marketing somthing that was doing just that as dangerous and new and everyone yeah basically do my own thing now or atleast the closest to my own thing can do at 15 id also like to add in that hilariously at one point identified with hot topic scene recently ive given that up because stopped being pretentious about it but still most of my tshirts were well find that in my head atleast the music that is going on is reaction to the world and is statement of what is going on so therefore believe that punk and any other type of music that thoughts on punk what is punk who is punk what makes band punk what makes person punk do you like punk are you punk is all this stupid bullshit is being popular selling out oh right forgot m 15 lol yeah hear you haven had anything to say for awhile so what kinda music into well it is self explanatory really how do infps feel about the beatles how the beatles have affected them and general thoughts on the beatles sadly no and was so alone last year had tried to create one in my mind created character profile and whenever the thought came to mind would visually imagine person there and talk to stephen king nuff said aleister crowley edward would proceed to call himself the great beast and would tell bella that he is entitled to her blood thats one chapter the rest of the book would dann think the problem lies not in their stupidity but rather your soul interesting how do you get to this level yeah for the most part am apathetic to all this petty high school bullshit very rarely will problem arise when care or people whos problems care for but the stupidity of it all just how do deal with all the idiots that surround me in my life how do begin to deal with the soulless scornfilled people have to be around every day aha thank you anyways now cross my fingers and hope for the best marimeli am aware of this don really care too much about money all need is enough money to survive and m good my instrument of choice is guitar but am currently learning saxophone marimeli thank you for your input ll be doing my best to do this am thinking career in music but have been considering taking an interest in other artistic fields while do this oh right forgot about that haha well let see where to begin well ll explain my former view formerly had this view that everyone sucked they ruined everything and theres no point but don understand what have to do to make difference or to begin trying just don want to be an idiot stuck with childish naivety as try to do something feel is important just hapalo that is implying that positive view is healthy but how can you be sure of that anyways wouldn say got healthy again because still possess all my old ideals just with less aaahh but am unable to do what my heart tells me to do because of the said reason this may seem like stupid question but how do you meditate ve thought of doing this for awhile but don marimeli it difficult though now see new possibility in the future never have before want to begin to do my best to begin to do what can for this fear that if wait it out and well ve recently had change within the inner workings of my mind and how work it probably for the best and is slightly more optimistic anyways find that because havent had any optimism the beatles never broke up am beatles fan but havent heard every labum or every song so tell me is this already in existence is it remix of existing beatles songs opinions interesting so where would the child be if he has failed to learn that from others and has in way learned it himself and failed within it interesting tried the same thing with different results as kid growing up the knowledge was there it just wasnt applied and explained so slowly began to think lowly of myself until however hear rumors that there are people who exist and aren like that fingers crossed no you are in no way negative or cynical in reality what you just said is how it works your not cynical you just dont want to be monotonous machine doing everything for selfish stupid your own morality and self are all that matter in the end you take everything in and choose how it will affect you and choosing how to exist through the limitations around you yes in my mind that is how it works the two would then cancel out and good and bad would cease to exist no more black and white only gray exactly it all depends on who is on the perceiving end of the spectrum for example if kill someone to save loved one that won be evil in the eyes of the person saved but it will be evil in ahhh nice was hoping someone would catch this everyone has their own morale rules that they won ever break because their psyche wont allow them to as long as the evil to them wont attempt to don know if id fully agree am person who has took the time to think out thoroughly my reasoning for some things considered evil as well as how would go about this evil and ive got to say miss the comfort in being sad frances farmer will have her revenge on seattle teenage angst has paid off well now im bored and old serve the servants think im dumb or maybe just self explanatory title ',\n",

              " ' thanks for the responses you guys are awesome proud do that too just wondering if it in my best interest have seasonal affective disorder which means the low light around this time of pretty much the same as other people here it usually people who are almost but not quite intps like and intj with weak or an istp with weak that sort of thing also have close this is going to be long but m wondering about quote from the intp description on intp org here the quote know the quote tries to answer this but my question is what happens if just from da vinci paintings m leaning toward there an incredible attention to detail in them picasso and van gogh seem like what artists would look like not exactly famous for most intps meet are pretty shy since m shy too it can be awkward being around them unfortunately have to practice socializing constantly whenever want to get better at it rolleyes good call there a broad consensus that she an intj according to mbti personality type doesn change how many infjs do you know usually find them either keeping their distance from me or smothering me there not much middle ground did look there but only once an intp female had mentioned that it would be so easy to be an intp male and then lot of intp males were frustrated because she didn get it because while life types love putting expectations on other people they like people to be focused and dependable and what looks from our perspective to be totally boring did you really complain about games yeah was wrong ellen page is as intp as they come this is rude of me to say but maybe it ll help other male intps pick out female intps it easiest for me to think of female intps as first don understand why you call delillo an intj he gives off very strong ti ne do have to list all the shallow clever ideas in white noise you seem to say that every major my personal experience is that when get stuck with my writing and ask infjs for help their ideas seem incredibly kitschy and their plots seem heavily heavily borrowed from overused hollywood agreed that salinger not an intp that really interesting about kafka never feel at home with him in the way do with other intp writers so ve never been convinced when saw him called the first time quit stayed clean for nearly three years found was able to work more productively without the distraction and cumulative unpleasantness of cigarettes jonathan franzen think of shigeru miyamoto who created zelda and super mario and donkey kong and star fox and pikmin and cetera as an infp though it possible he an intp in the last interview we re withdrawn competitors for lack of better way to say it we re not in your face competitive like entjs are but at least in my case if see have good chance of winning something don understand this part at all what do you think my post was about let me know if m misinterpreting you when you put it like this you make this trust thing seem like sacrifice its both of course itd all so be logicle if oth peeps learnt how 2 gramer properlly sew wee cud spend are tiem lernin hao too comunicate two feelerz rathur then waist awl are tim so let me get this straight you and your girlfriend have different ways of making decisions you like to make decisions without consulting the other person she prefers to make them via logical m not so sure about this mean understand that having social skills can have value but the amount of work and energy needed for an intp to acquire them seems bit high considering the payoff think lot of your volubility comes from the fact that you ve got higher energy level than most people it good to know about yourself but don think the mbti describes energy don get m sorry m going to have to stop this discussion we ve hit an impasse where my response to lot of what you re saying would be exactly the same as my last post it seems like you re trying to yeah but my contention is that your definitions of the functions are flawed that why consulted outside sources because it easy but pointless for me to say that m right but much more must not call you nutcase i going to continue my appeal to authority argument about depp by googling try johnny depp infp and get we both believe that johnny depp is an depp is consistently typed as infp almost everywhere on the internet aren you an infp that would explain why you can relate so strongly to him with regard to dante d say his strict conan brien shocked his music seems really inefficient d say he an extroverted thinker not an introverted thinker you might look into modern classical for intps guys like shostakovich or messiaean have you the jung as infj argument ve heard is that jung int type is closer to the mbti type infj than it is to intp again don know this stuff well enough to argue it myself from what you say about jung definitely has strong ti the people who say he infj point out that thinking is preferred over feeling for males in our society so even an infj male could have very well developed ti see religion esp christianity as more conservative form of atheism it easiest to understand this when you look g at galileo who the christians condemn at first then when they finally weird my intj sister can seem too long winded to me intjs seem to know what they want to say but it seems like te has to repeat the points it making sometimes several times to make absolutely there are couple movie directors was wondering about sofia coppola and richard kelly seem like obvious intps but there are couple others who might or might not be intps and was wondering that probably seasonal affective disorder it annoys me when m depressed and people tell me to man up or whatever and get over it as if it were that easy usually it not their fault because writing with proper capitalization is an attempt to fit in which is handled by fe it also been proven that homo sapiens can read properly capitalized sentences faster than sentences with no in the short term we don if you give us enough time to think about something hours or days we can realize we re wrong we use lot of superfluous filler words viz really you re doing it again tongue think lot of us do happy almost forgot lisbeth salander in addition to these',\n",
              " ' are infps emotionally expressive so m an infp hi and one supposedly uncharacteristic trait or so ve assumed about myself is that am often very openly emotionally expressive is some people never learn that it an individual thing not all of them though mean well am an infp no m not mistyped yes am sure and while am very cautious with what this exactly this feel the same way about entjs usually me she is sometimes doubtful about her decisions because ve told her before that she seems self righteous to me so she asks what my opinion on matter at hand is and then step in and oh my god that is so intense never linked that vibe to the infj type but can see now why they are often described that way xd there is something intense yet mesmerising about this guy he the hammer

you feel to see someone you care about go through that and think that do you think it might be the medication he on cause oka thanks for the information but ll give you some heads up my sister has had manic episode many when we were younger and before she went to hospitals treatment centers then place hmm oka but really who isn under stress but that might be true just ve been through way more stressful things then what is going on now and usually take it extremely good know they will things dont stay sucky forever just gotta stay positive last night she was just in the er and her ex boyfriend broke in the house our neighbors caught him and that is great thought but my mom can barely keep the house and food on the table we just got her insurance and she has seen therapist and stuff before but now that she is out of oh and sometimes some people consider me awkward because m so bubbley does that happen with you can just tell they are like whoa haha for parties like it when people are being active and partying it up m usually the one trying to start games or rocking out to music try to talk to everyone and ya usually try oka could maybe make the cookies at my dads sense

curious what do you guys do to make you feel better or for happiness cause m trying to find new ways to make myself feel important mellow ha ya m trying really hard to stay happy it isn that hard plus have soccer tonight so this should make me feel better with excirsising and talking with people mean yesterday truthfully don think ve done that before surprisingly xd hahah dont think you are insane or crazy just maybe you are zoned out at less they are like me hate when people touch me when m crying so listening is the best bet and like everyone said comforting words just be there let your instincts on what to do all can say is thank you so much and ha feel for ya curitaderana the scary times are tough but when look back there are some pretty funny times and m big laugh it off shrug it know m huge on organization like when the house is mess never really know waht to do with other peoples stuff but try to just make it look nice make it look neat and while m thanks this helps alot and really what is taring me and really don wanna sounds like person that has issues alot and everything andi don wanna be burden don wanna bet everyone goes through that m perrrty sure hehe the goal thing is great idea and truthfully don have much of an idea on the in and stuff thanks so much that helpedd alot nice to know someone kinda gets what to say or how to give advice laughing mean they are so unloveable they don want to cooperate and let you go they wanna keep you forever hehe hahah well you can think easily and think swamps are evil while try to think of them aas something beautiful and add habitate to the world xd laughing swamps are too outgoing they invite all the insects frogs turtles snakes and other nature things to let them live with them how isn that outgoing d drawing isn only art you could be good at painting sculptures making up dances cooking writing poetry personally m werid and like to call many things art anything created hahaha always nice to have backups and don worry m sure it just time just don doubt yourself hehe alrighty was going through an emotional time and was kinda like need to stop being so down so started to think of random things and tell me why you think they need that hehe well he super understanding and caring if bring it up to him know he ll try or want to fix it right away and probably doesn even know it bothering mee haha just hate to hurt well it mainly over phone chat and txt he like that not in person we both live in different towns and think communication is huge thing in relationship so is it cause he doesn that exactly it feel so down hate being downers for others and it really eats at me when know someone cant help me or don know how to allow them and know it feels horrible laughing that greatt and bet that made you feel wonderful m proud truthfully really don fully understand the ni yet because just started this but think with your assuming you are jumping to conclusions do this all the time maybe even for your mom even though this is really not your responsibility but if it ll make you feel better go for it but for you mom seems like she has hard time trying to love herself point out agree you have to go through gut feeling and who has told the truth more in the past ya know you are right and it a horrible habit but it the only way can take things one step at time kinda deal but oka lets say have asked him why he isn talkative and he what do you mean by shadow behavior and that pretty much it just it getting too me think ll be oka thanks the problem is feel like m being blocked out from others otherwise usually surround myself with tons of people could we have toothpaste tower xd oka everytime hit an object say sorry too it like if run into the wall willsay sorry to it hmm when get really happy have this need to like scream and just be like wooohhh m an enfj and dont think it reading observ and understand why people do things and where they are coming from more then anything m good at knowing why someone does something ya so m like if you are busy we can talk later then he like no no no and then barely says anything but then some days he actually tries to add to the conversation and m sure he when meet new people tend to be crazyy and woooh to see how they react to me and actually try to make an effort to be my friend also observe the person their actions what they say and yes this literally does drive me crazyy too like with my friends or something if m going somewhere and know wont even have my phone for example with me will tell them before hand so it does help me undersstandd thanks but mean by emotionally is don like burdening people with my problems and know he just wants to help but too like to suffer alone truthfully have the exact same problem but understand their actions more considering need friends they say they will be there for me but really best advice can give is hint ',\n",

her another woman like you would mistress simply friend who happens to be female she isn the only female friend have or the only one sent xmas gifts too and my wife is perhaps but yes as never ever wanted to cause her pain our friendship will stay terminated quote viajador 14275642 sounds like she got feelings for you which explains the impulsive in hindsight agree the gifts may have been overboard my best friend over the last 13 years is woman entp met at my last job in fact she coming back to my state for visit and she ok at new job quickly noticed an attractive coworker d run into the halls work seemingly daily always smiling at me soon it became apparent to me she was flirting you know it had to be learn to smile more nah there are personality types that are drawn to us just by us being us personally ve found most not all of my relationships in life follow true to socionics concept of quadras our quadra agree that why married one always found entp and fashion to be antonyms 1 cannot decipher their own feelings emotions especially strong ones and tend to compartmentalize them to avoid them 2 if they get hurt in relationship by someone they geniunely care about that tongue not the best of friends to have entp generally have too little resilience for relationship setbacks typically if an entp feelings are hurt can only be done by someone they geniunely care and when we re not stressed we pay very little attention to details of our physical environment they do develop as we mature hence now have become considerably more socially inclined as reached for clarification if you re an intj you are ni te fi se in that order we all are that what dictates being an intj we just differ in the rate and degree of development of those four conscious once if get comfortable in the relationship d say pretty damn good happy what he said similar scenario happened to me when was in my late teens involving an isfp gal fell head over heels for her there in lies the seeds of destruction for young intj as we unhealthy intj are often experiencing an inferior function episode that can last days to months normally they ll resemble an esfp in negative childish sort of way projection of unconscious weak passions escatology typology nutrition all things relating to dogs tell me about it going on 10 months now with an entp was close to at one time and apparently crossed the magic line and poof don exist anymore so irrational not friends anymore ok see limerance as natural state that all types fall into now and again sometimes it ends sometimes it matures into love how long it lasts or how frequently it occurs might me type related if you ll pardon me the image of vampire bat comes to mind they ll suck little blood for nourishment move on to others then come back another day when the host has made more fresh this is something learned few years back about entp this is part of maintaining successful friendships you ll basically need to let the friendship be directed by the entp ve managed good information guess the only part that bothers me is the cold shoulder silent treatment what that all about don hold grudges and after few days week m ready to mend fences at one speaking from an outsiders point of view and one who has won lost few entp friendships connecting initially comes naturally as an intj what tends to happen is when the friendship even inner is there basic criteria common to all types or is it type specific as an intj can someone be considered close friend if you only socialize with them at work school or very specific setting m wasn refering to permanent changes that come about through maturity or personal growth but rather those temporary out of character episodes negative all folks go through from time to time entp really have unique definition of loyality you tend to be loyal to friends that make you happy the problem here especially if it one of those rare folks you ve made rare apparently so you write too much like an entp guess tongue hmmmm go by the name sunlover tongue what defines person type is the sequence of the 8 cognitive functions however what varies between those of the same type is the development rate of the functions and the resultant interplay another very important yet often overlooked aspect to successful longterm romantic relationship is knowing each others love language ve seen some relationships that were not very compatible so true one the real negatives of being an xntx there are so few of us around to find someone to relate with some months back had falling out with the only xntx was close friends with an all the above especially the part about indifferent dismissive to others feelings and emotions dry that funny as ve also felt m some sort of entp magnet what ve learned is that normally it ya ll who get the ball rolling sometimes almost appearing pushy in developing the friendship surrounded by heathens just kidding tongue from non entp perspective don be so hard on yourself what you need to realize is your having and expressing emotions is no more the problem than entp not being able to understand or express we intj don handle strong emotions of any type well it will eventually mess up our thought processes kind of like computer virus that tends to slow things down and generally gunk up the ve always gone by the credo if everyone is heading this way ll head the other way cool yes provided the change was initiated by me wink human nature never changes we don all subscribe we came from apes either wink it funny ve had

wouldn be to see if someone would come to didn he well maybe that would be too unreal to have dad like that like something out of the movies but if you spoke those words accept the truth of your own words as you say many not understanding the ppps pink political photos maybe infjs should give their views and opinions more from the heart and the mind dilemma though like but whats with the mickey mouse holding hands with the scary creature in front of the burning car well thought what you said was deeply poetic and if your dad truly said something like that you are truly blessed coming from the deep south of south london england lol thought what you problems with giving opinions sometimes m happy to and will fight for them other times less so because 1 my deepest views and values that will be misunderstood or judged this s don follow politics in the states much though we have lots of pictures of trump in our newspapers who are shocked with some of his remarks however perhaps in true infj style think m from the uk and for me the word liberal has become more and more pejorative term for me political liberals live in privileged world usually cut off from real difficulty but they still as understand it ni is not always immediately verbal our instant intuition can be fast but perhaps relatively unconscious at least to begin with so you get an impression of something i think my post had two agendas reflected in the answers first sorry to go on bit but was distressed by counsellor reaction guess fe tried to smooth it over at the time it st elmos and hppygirl thank you for your comments was taken aback too that the counsellor didn understand what was getting at and seemed to immediately go down the pathology road it nabbit for few years tested infp before sudden change to infj which has remained the same for long time generally would guess infjs fairly open expressive faces trying not to give too much away but failing miserably am sometimes taken back at how closed flat and expressionless many peoples interesting for the record should add think overall feel born this way so strong disposition would say though with society and family expectations playing their part but am saw another thread recently called fe is magic on auxillary function feeling extrovert which was interesting in it the poster referred to an article of the same name by stellarmaze which just wondering showed new counsellor saw only few times page of infj material she seemed to think it explained what was wrong with me as result of my childhood which she knew thanks hppygirl am glad you kinda get where am coming from another book arrived on my doorstep yesterday the orphan journey to wholeness by audrey punnett in case it is of interest to yep agree about being aware already at least to some degree but my added extra take is that maybe we also miss stuff g appreciation maybe sometimes equally people might find it thanks to everyone contributions further thoughts on this those brain cells are sure working hard was reading about jungian archytypes yesterday think that kind of feeds into so very much what rather unusual says here it kindof explains what think am trying to get at and why perhaps we sometimes feel so isolated also really appreciate what umop 3pisdn and mystiko yeah lol when get attention appreciation validation can feel quite confronted at times and don really want it its like it messes with my flow but it can be nice if done first off just feeling bit sorry for myself this afternoon was just wondering why infjs often feel unappreciated and unseen and if anyone could shed any light on this think perhaps thinks fgs stop boasting about your kids says nothing thinks why do you think you re so great says nothing thinks god why why why on earth are you so bossy how does anyone around quote khiro 24438794 was but then experienced what it like to be hated and it not as awful as expected actually think it strengthens you great deal because you re forced to accept quote tthomas 24225786 because infj people hidden agenda is to be healthy interesting tthomas kindof get that agenda though can put it into words exactly but thank you personally don have lot of people running up to me for free therapy which is shame as have lot to offer lol infj can be little standoffish you know maybe we look like we might this this new year was around lot of different people at gathering the people nice and really enjoyed some of it but when people are rude bossy or boring do feel like need to oops think said these are the questions one should ask oneself hppygirl comment reminded me of an article shameless and loveless read year ago it argues that sexual shame is good thing and that it can have protective value it is schutzgefühl also wonder if infjs more likely to be single am in my 50s and have been single all my life to be honest wish had realised it earlier on and made more of it in way though think yes think that is what was trying to say and the downside of tying you down to obligation to convention or as read yesterday quote from anais nin disregard the proportions m from uk but always found this american expression fascinating believe it has its origins in political policy sponsorship lol for me it means you are given reality in which you are loved the dubliners one of my favourite short stories ever did read hesse in my teenage years found him somehow probably in library here in the uk who knows how infjs find what yes think totally get what you say fabi the quiet inner knowing of childhood before we had to learn fancy words to explain ourselves sometimes still feel it and think it is great have found what helps is to keep going having an enquiring spiritual mind can be great blessing finally found my

there anything can do will either think about it go on forums google it very occasionally seek advice though usually advice doesn help much gosh just come off the phone to my son school not being kept informed of anything by the school office staff member being passive aggressive and stupid and refusing to take responsibility had strange realisation last night m typical sensitive infj plus been in difficult circumstances many times in my life perhaps partly through my idealism partly fate know you may be right it may be the kinder gentler option it could be that simple agree its always about putting themselves over others too have reflected bit more and suspect that kinda don like to get involved but if do something in the real world e step outside my home and open my mouth my experience has been you get involved do like to think we also find it completely confusing when people behave badly for no obvious reason when we never would if we could in any way help it anyway maybe that the crux we re just totally columbo what else intherockies thank you read your link thread makingcuts and was like wow the entj door slam is mostly simple quick and painless they don look back or even

              " ' you know that side of you that charming and very well liked but it not quite who you are and you know that side of you that very deeply who you are and when revealed makes you shy and ll try and explain in way which will hopefully make sense an istjs default way of being is often perceived as rejection by an enfp for example istj is fixing fence istj is ok have to drag this thread back up again just to write my happy conclusion everything was fine we were friends again but just needed to hear you re good friend from him ended hihi thanks nice post oh man this have you ever loved so much it hurt inside well that the only way my love can be described is rare and ve only felt this for very small handful of people all of whom have that funny for me it like if don say anything one can normally assume that either m trying really hard to not say anything or things aren fine or don really care about you so it sounds to me like you have grudge against particular enfp who somehow hurt you in the past and you re taking it out on all of us firstly if ever told someone that love them and oh and to answer you guys about the emails yeah they were long winded about nothing and just for chat so they thoroughly wound him up which deep down think was what was actually thank you very much guys you re extremely helpful that interesting that it feels like the obligatory xmas present thing can relate to that so that makes it much easier for me to oi that not helpful answer this is exactly my problem need simple way of explaining the above to an istj in way that won make his head hurt maybe there is no such way was expecting that kind of reply hehe but yeah with close friends which he is do don need it all the time even once in lifetime would do just to occasionally to say to someone haha yeah istjs can be brutal don think they have clue ve recently met colleague who an istj and when he has supervisor shifts everybody terrified of him told him so jokingly and hi istjs haven been on this forum in while so first of all hi secondly d like to ask for some advice on how to phrase something in way that would make sense to an istj or sometimes you guys need to remember that we don know the things you don tell us as an example lets say you have an absolute ton of work to get through and we ask you for help with oh it be dreadful i really can even begin to imagine how awful it be think the same applies to any world where there would be just one type we need variety anyway enfps thrive thanks for your replies know post lot of questions on your forum and m sorry if they come out as repetitive or anything it cos all my important relationships in my life have been just find it hard to understand why it wouldn cross someone mind it like at the forefront of my mind to constantly automatically say things to people like it so nice to see you had question in the title maybe m asking the obvious but m just wondering why you don think to do it why it so difficult yep 3 plus 1 cup of tea m definitely back to normal lol well it never rains but it pours ran into him today and it turned out to be good thing because we established that we re both sorry that don want to argue and we don want to hate each completely take responsibility for what did and if ever felt hurt as result then accept that never considered myself victim in this situation if anyone interested in the reason it thank you niss very true today for the first time in few months spent day with friends where this guy who had fling with was also present so much built up tension and resentment it fine don worry wouldn feel judged even if you wrote you re horrible person ve spent enough time thinking all this stuff through and trying to come to terms with it of course we of course know when ve crossed line but it because from the minute met the person the line was crossed ll admit once had an affair with guy who was with someone else from the agree that my example was bit rubbish but really like fiveberries example the thing is that sometimes you don actually realize you have an emotional connection with someone until it niss and dizzle thanks good replies what if you re perfectly happy content you love your partner you wouldn exchange him her for anything and you know you want to spend your life together but one day you lock eyes with someone thanks guys please don think m desperate for immediate replies do understand that some people are always on their phones and some aren and it simply that when get little or no yeah regarding the post about enfps mellowing with age that definitely true but for me personally it taken quite some effort on my part to be less smothering and m not sure m quite there m not obliging you to read it it funny used to think was really good at understanding istjs thanks to myers briggs and recently ve discovered that it often not really the case however to think he must be about 10x now understand why when my istj friend told me he didn have time for discussion once he annoyed me with something and wanted to talk about it got really angry told him that if he thanks see that was the kind of translation needed hehe that so weird for me tho trying to interpret an istj behaviour is like sticking needle through my own toe this is funny because my colleagues and class mates and even some quite close friends have often said to me that seem to be the most rational self sufficient confident person they know m friendships should end based on certainty not on doubt when rocky period occurs you might doubt that normal but that not enough of good reason to end friendship however once you re thank you just one comment the fact that m constantly texting you means that m already feeling exactly the way you feel when text you too much threatened drained and frustrated well if you re interested his response to if didn happen to really care about you as friend wouldn have bothered to bring all this up or to try and explain what was going on in my head sorry don think was being very clear it not that need him to constantly say xyz to me all wanted was to know whether he actually considers me as friend worth having or not so much yeah that kind of what did except that think that now he kind of feeling like m accusing him that it somehow his fault which wasn i just sent him this please don tell me it was afraid someone would say that so the only way can explain this to him is the way you feel right now like bewildered and confused and fed up with me is the way was feeling with you ok that great ll stop all texts like we re at the pub if you fancy joining us and turn them into questions ve noticed that he doesn really respond to statements so that a really know ll phrase it like this is there anything not myers briggs related that makes you confused frustrated fed up and bewildered thanks to everyone who ve replied can thank some people on here for some reason thanks for the last post hobbes you sound like my friend lol as in it could be him writing that to answer the first questioner he replied to texts that had question mark on the end of them like do you want to join us at the pub but not to texts that didn like we re at the pub if you how can explain to someone who an istj am 110 sure of that and who has never heard of myers briggs and whom can explain myers briggs to why need to hear things in order to know but don you mind the fact that if you don reply when someone you care about needs emotional reassurance you re making them feel drained frustrated and rejected and that if this repeats itself ve never had such intense and bewildering relationships with anyone like have with istjs these relationships can be so beautiful and the communicating difficulties can really make you feel thanks lot for all your replies think this thing has taught me how intense and crazy hormons and attraction can make you feel and how many stupid things it can make you do think that decided to post about this on here to see what responses might get ve had feelings for an istj guy for year we work together he in serious relationship and has family apparently of all the personality types you guys seem to be the most bothered by people who are fake complicated putting on an act talking nonsense over analyzing and you seem to be the most

as well as the body mentally feel much better when am active considering his picture yes that weird truly think exercise will provide significant improvements you can help but feel better about yourself it just happens and it can be free and all natural getting into consistent exercise it creates endorphins and really helps with depression personally have had periods of being in funk and the last thing want to do is any form of physical activity but if you enfps d like to see what all the hype is about can remember where heard this but it has really stuck with me the pain of regret hurts far worse than the pain of discipline 1 do you like tea specifically hot tea yerba mate sometimes generally coffee is my thing but if m trying to scale back on some bad habits switch to yerba mate 2 do you often think sunshine makes me happy m channeling my happiness have been wondering this too and still don get the purpose mean why the different icons bit lonely at the moment just saw show on stephen hawking the grand design he actually has book out called this it answered question similar to this pretty interesting omgosh yes and love scouring through mountains of data to find the one little anomoly that is throwing everything else off people think am freak that can do that lol m such nerd excess packaging for whatever reason that annoys the crap out of me where exactly are you dangling these feathers laughing this is an easy one to answer if they spend any amount of time with you then they have some level of care and respect for you if they didn care or respect you they wouldn give you btw think this link in the intj strengths section pretty much sums up how it would could be easy for us to reach our goals when those strengths are well developed things just seem to happen lol ok maybe that wasn the ideal word it just seems like intjs easily take the steps action toward our dreams goals and we therefore ultimately end up achieving them guess as have matured maybe you need to take step back and work on the smaller goals that will lead you to your larger goals to be loved truly and deeply loved intjs have the unique ability to envision something dream specific goal etc and then effortlessly make it happen develop your intj abilities and this will make sense yes you all are fun and cuddly and make us smile of course we love you completely agree as have matured and now fully understand my intj qualities recognize that can accomplish any dream have no matter how big or small time and motion are the only factors stupid people hey now it was just little silly humor s 39927 recently within the last couple weeks went through something similar didn read all the posts but gathered enough to see similarities found out my boyfriend had been lying about think anyone would have been shaken up in that moment m so glad you are still with us and nothing horrible happened will channel my karmic powers so that this will come back to bite that someone tried to kill you wth very well said concur welcome enjoy the forum when you get excited to see nova show on black holes quantum physics etc when you have and weird aversion to even numbers example if my alarm clock goes off and ve been hitting snooze won actually get up until the sum of the numbers on the clock equal an odd ok enough talking about it go do it and report back wink even more depressing now my nose is too long for my ears 39574 well this was depressing got an 8 44 and my ears are too long for my nose pppfffttt agree think it a long shot due to the age difference but heck see what happens just be prepared to remain friends d love that d find it amazing actually quote great will probably asking be asking him out soon well he is about 15 years older than me am 20 quote that 20 vs 35 could be the last guy dated came around lot and was obviously flirting with me but could not bring myself to be as obvious in my reciprocations had major crush on him but didn want to seem like us intjs are not ones to take initiative so you better do it personally only end up on date or in relationship if am relentlessly pursued and am relieved when someone else takes that now that am becoming more aware and perceptive to the different types can look back at few that m sure were enfps we had crazy chemistry and were drawn together like magnets unfortunately so where do find an enfp oh wait guess they have to find me huh welcome to the forum you came to the right place welcome to the forum ',\n",
              " ' some of anthony gonzalez m83 seems fairly intp to me but don get strong intp vibe perhaps more of an infp ve always gotten the result of intp since had lot of childhood trauma that am recovering from at 30 wonder if am actually an intp or am just broken something else that is now edit nm heraclitus seems like an intp to me he resembled mystic more than philosopher and don think intj would make use of all the symbolism that he did nietzsche does not seems like an intj at same never thought was definitely smarter but just that lived further up the mountain from higher vantage point perhaps even higher than lot of extremely smart people high level two days crying people who are overly patriotic and actually believe the whole america compassionate muslims germans russians evil barbarians feel the same way sometime when try to debate discuss philosophy with people who claim to understand it console myself by telling myself that philosophy is the finger pointing at the moon think it clear that society is changing try not to simply entertain doomsday thoughts society is incredibly complex infinitely more complex than two party ideals of left and right work in god you are so right am only 30 and lot of things that happened when was 25 seem like year or two ago lump them more or less into the same general time span as the present it an odd how do you guys all feel about turning 30 didn have great first three decades 25 30 was pretty good guess but everything before that was something will never reflect back on or include think the movie koyaanisqatsi is very intp had the same issue especially in my lower 20 although spent lot of time dissociating from life and imagining other things too d say ultimately like alan watts said the mind can know well we started off across from each other and ate on opposite sides of the booth sitting next to me is more intimate think closer it a way of saying she likes me perhaps perhaps it just because of childhood issues and lack of experience until my late 20 i am dealing with this girl ve went on 2 dates with and just tried to call her quickly hung up had that thought many times and didn like him as character at all perhaps because he was so soft and timid which is an intp trait in myself was disgusted with he definitely an intp when was four thought that santa was ridiculous belief remember being in my private church kindergarten too and feeling distinct feeling of hopelessness and fear that lived in world can tell for sure but rust cohle from true detective seems pretty intp feel like there is common perception that the intp are the nerdy introverts the computer nerds socially inept dungeons and dragons type would say that more of the intj myself although can we overanalyze to the point where we start philosophizing about the reality of elections the mindlessness of the masses what difference this so called leader can make over this other leader just wrote an enormous post on life personal growth and all that sort of stuff decided not to post it because it was just my own inner processing in any case what do you all think about this decided to look at my ex facebook has gorgeous new facebook picture wearing cuter clothes than she ever did with me looks healthy our relationship was pretty effed up but m so sad some swede thanks for the wonderful post indeed most people don realize that at all everyone ve talked to who either went to highly rated engineering program or got an advanced degree remarked ve always underachieved in school largely due to trauma think but just like knowing who my favorite ninja turtle was think as kid always felt physics was what was most interested in am still getting read on my own intelligence it is possible that the people am encountering are smarter than me but it seems to me they are just more comfortable taking information at face to me think of daniel tosh humor as very infj very cruel and seemingly insulting the person value as soul and life essence but in shallow and feminine way but m perhaps seeing why is everyone so difficult and why can everyone see how great am makes total sense guy seemed obsessed with status in almost royal sense of the word even in other facial expressions he lash out like queen if the peasant had dared express autonomy if since had traumatic childhood feel like am not quite sure of my type m pretty sure it an intp or entp probably had severe dissociation as child which put me into my imagination even the concept know arises in thought rudolf steiner who d peg as pretty well split intp intj wrote lot about this we can only know thoughts or thinking as an active property of what was going to say bro you are j not p then realized you already knew that see that on amazon there are more than few books on being an intp and learning to maximize your strengths anyone here have book they recommend listened to it and liked the lyrics as well as the song thanks for posting them didn read them yesterday believe free will is an illusion but probably an important one it is important that we behave as if it were real even though its not so no didn choose to post here everything about life how can death be permanent death is non existence the non existence of even non existence think eckhart tolle said it well when he said death is not the opposite of life death is the just ask because good friend of mine for 20 years was an infj and was incredibly abusive and cruel m trying to make sense of how his personality configured itself in such way where he could you see there is no evidence for god correct but there is equally no evidence for human agency for decisions for free will for whatever these are all ideas just like the idea of god intj seem to have very rigid personalities and belief systems and are much more prone to self celebration they can be violent and forceful when you question so called established truths they that makes total sense and is what m going through now it been hard at work where people younger than me are in higher positions and where m regarded as the smartest person in my department clash with intj pretty badly because don think they see the big picture or beyond their own ideas but goddamnit wish had the ability to just read and understand science like they think intp see beyond ideas or the limited nature of the mind and its concepts better than any other mbti type think this is why we clash so badly with intj they worship ideas like or also maybe rent moving truck drive it into the middle of nowhere where no one will be for weeks handcuff my arms behind my back and then lock myself in but have plenty of water no m just not that afraid of pain it not about the pain its about celebrating life and also that all experiences are temporary including the pain don even know it not well formed think life is beautiful m not going to show it the disrespect of simply turning it off at worst my method would be half hour or so of excruciating pain it wouldn be that bad and it those are some really good points now that think about it he has some pronounced intp like traits but agree the action oriented aspects with strong executive functioning are very un intp dr since it such huge decision decided would only do it in way that was incredibly painful most likely d drive out into remote area in middle of the desert in july then torch my car went to an intp group in my city and stated atheism is religion when they turned the topic to atheism was not well received thanks ve done some of thought and thought about that many times sometimes get started and then stop because have lot of resentment towards the pleasure focused mode of operating toward to some degree it really delightful and wonderful ve had lot of suffering in my life because of health issues and moreso because of awful parents but you can really cleanse your mind and winners never quit and quitters never win ',\n",

cuba is probably the most enfp place yeah but the people have such an interesting amount of imagination and they have some sort of si due to their religious views at least ne si right maybe estj is correct but entp could also be joey infp paola esfp devin estp brittany isfj amber isfj jocasta esfj hayden esfp zach enfp or entp but definitely an ne dom he seems like he uses fi though cody esfj caleb estp am going to say you can get more enfp country than ireland made an argument for uae being enfp based on functions but uae is not perfect example of an enfp country uae could easily be toad is actually an enfp he does not use any se plus he has the ne sense of humor maybe vietnam is actually infp why ti over fi for deidara your argument for an ne dom was impeccable and couldn give better argument myself but think his obsession of wanting his art to be respected by sasuke and itachi am going back and forth in my head towards the end he seems esfp again am just going to go with esfp isn it obvious itachi is an infj and sasuke is an intj people here already argued for it so don think need to elaborate peter infp harry osborn enfp it is so clear that he is an nfp gwen enfj electro infp rhino esfp lizard intp che guevara was surely an nf he risked his life in cause he believed in his cause he wanted to help others even though he knew he could die what is so istp about that he was master nobody who has read lot about che would say he is an istp he went to congo just to freaking laughing help people fight of the ruthless evil leader he killed people because they were working after re watching her there is nothing about her just typed her that because she was following orders from fury stereotypical istj just follows the rules but she is more than that she is entp could be possible but in his diaries and biography the fi is just so clear he is more te as opposed to ti even the way his friends described him fi wants to help people as well just in that is the most ridiculous thing have read lived in canada and can promise you it is not sensory dominate it is also joke that people think india in reality is enfp india is most likely seems like an enfp would say enfp 3w4 where is the se in him in his interviews see 0 se it is funny how only stps are saying he is an stp he is clear entp he is clear ne dom and his ti is also obviously there yeah dubai seems ne to me think it is too te to be entp doha seems very entp though imo doha entp dubai enfp or entj seems either te or ne dominate the crazy architecture shows signs vietnam exfj sorry it has to be fe dom have never been but based on more info it doesn seem as enfp as thought edit uae seems to be ne te the way my friend describes dubai he lives there it sounds very enfp abu dhabi sounds bit entj uae sounds like place with an enfp ne persona mixed with an intp clear as day light entj could be an but he is definitely an ntj mello enfp honestly the ne fi in him is clear he is the only enfp in the show near intj am pretty positive always though he was an esfp but you could make good argument for enfp m gonna go with esfp though lol jordan is not an enfp enfps would never screw people the

favorite movies of all time all the characters struck me as ns loki is not an estp that is one of the most off typings have seen since when is se his dominate function he uses ni to the max he is either infj or intj he way too big picture to be sensor edit sunspot is not an enfp was writing very quickly he is probably an entj sabertooth is more likely estp im enfp competitive soccer player

me which would mean that would be incompetent which in turn would shatter everything that is important to me are you someone who gives gifts with the expectation that they ll get service or gift that equally or more beneficial in return someone who gives gifts but then later takes it boiled them in salted water maybe that why it tastes better than what you ve had in the past lima beans taste like

response out of me have hard time being happy for people instead of analyzing where does one find people who like intjs is there like certain age when people realize that we aren all that bad if give

could be that he is the same way and is unsure this doesn really work if the intj isn interested in physics though even still they probably look at you like you were an idiot they have to understand reasons for my behavior but also force me to do things wouldn normally do they have to be direct they should be complex person with goals and have the drive to there re probably intjs around you that

isfp think we need an introvert sensor to keep us on track and on task but someone who is feely to smooth over things and p to be flexible on deadlines and not get all rigid like s compared to yep infjs meet are always on the verge of emotional implosion because they feel no one wants to understand them or they feel mistreated if something is not going right they re constantly they re kinda like istps completely anti social social at the same time if they like someone which could be platonic curiosity romantic they will approach the person but sooner or later their got to hand it to estps being master charmers giving you what you want your esfj friend is right but also keep in mind sps such as yourself are short sighted of future concerns someone being infjs have this if intjs have this stop that you don want to be stupid emo poetic yoga infjs do you definitely an entp for patterns people entj is far superior in developing project and moving along steps they are superb for businesses organizations etc if were to pick business manager and perfect job for intp is pretty much being left alone to master something important to them if it graphic arts graphic designer with the latest and greatest software hardware to assist if it compatibility is much more than mbti socionics more than likely the intp with the esfj above who is together probably has good number of things in common mbti compatibilty doesn also take don you guys find it absolutely ludicrous to create survey about staying home lot most types can stay home lot that is nothing unique to intps yes worship the isfp and be nice man you guys are way too demanding infantile babies infjs have martyr complexes ve seen way too many threads of infj isfp issues the infj gets into relationship because they see isfp as someone who they can mutually try to understand and they you gotta be kidding me see isfps all the time dancing and drinking 3 5 drinks at bars clubs have witnessed this over and over stop being self righteous and making isfps seem all innocent hello my infantile isfps it so wonderful that miracles seeker the entp asks so many random vague questions in the isfp forum when he is so shy at posting under his actual anonymous handle or at very udgemental of an isfp personally think intj women have too high of standards of their mate to consider us as their equals they must think we are too unpredictable and immature to deal with them on close terms nt nt isfjs are cool people from long distance think enfps are attracted to istjs because they assume that their psycho babble will help istj open up and istj same forth for enfp thinking they can be not sure if this is trait that is shared with other entps but if do get into relationship after awhile my gut tells me that it not working literally spend lot of time on the best way to find isfps are very accepting and work very well with my personality that likes to move about and be random my only dislike is that they take their work too seriously and need to relax more they and an infj outsider to boot to spread negative propaganda that may be incorrect to add meh whatever bs cognitive function you re spouting needs to be backed by web link that clearly shows would fancy the idea of being temporary dictator for the sake of advancing others but not for long term have yet to meet an infp that does not smoke marijuana actively when mean actively mean every day or every other day you asked question how an entp would behave better question would be how would an entp behave towards an infj since you the original author indicate in your profile that you are an infj now nf vs nt is gonna kick in eventually so great for short term it would look like the following cemetery military barracks prison any sort of system that is orderly no nonsense and factual not to say anything negative in fact far more all your base are belong to us that just facade most enfps have bookshelves of self help psychology books mainly on relationships as if it was the most important thing in the world healthy isfjs female working in the home cooking baking doing crafts cleaning male cleaning home improvement fixing stuff both generally very open studious quiet unhealthy ones there will be some head butting and contrasts between on issues of right and wrong most likely the estj will want to maintain higher level of rank than an enfp if you re okay with that as friends you sure you re an isfp ve read several of your posts and you come off as an infp infps can be pseudo aggressives and get that sense from you that sentence can be said of any type and here another thing people kinda dislike behaviors of others from what they see in themselves infjs can be such saviors of others which is great for those that keep their word and provide consistent behavior bad for those who don operate in such sense deep open communicative verbal reassurances that are clear and consistently constant not sure if your random isfp can provide that all the time this is called relations of benefit relations of benefit between psychological personality types see the same trend with infjs with isfps but not enfp esfj or entp estj the intj sees sure it can work both of you will be planning and doing lots of adventures however think there will be an element of missing emotions think you both will do fine as long as you don plan to controlling agree on nothing shows emotion when he losing control don know too many entps that behave like that when things get more chaotic entps get more calm and precise every buy pet dog so she is distracted away from your needs how can help her out of this from personality stand point space and time actually helps quite lot she got better but okay from definition of cognitive functions life as project so this must be mbti fe extraverted feeling connecting considering others and the group organizing to meet their needs yeah agree enfps my cousins can be slutty trying to figure the easiest way to get into someone pants chaos she is not into you being non descript as possible once was at social event and this isfj hung around an isfp for hours like he wouldn leave her eventually bumped into her and love istp women probably as friends though can get them to do stereotypical guy stuff and they ll do it well but do feel slightly insecure but not because am man myself but it competes no you are incorrect isfps are fe si the difference between se or si is that se will utilize their environment and interact with it cooking gardening si will draw in sensory perceptions with you got it all backwards plus one real annoying shit about intps is that they make up or rearrange mbti socionics what is this demonic trickster etc crap don mind perseus intp setting up she not that into you if she truly was an isfp she would be open to hanging out with you so go ahead and move on so ya know him for 10 years do just that tell him the next day he will bring measuring tape for your ring finger and guarantee you 1 carat diamond ring by the next week no joke know intps mistake isfps as esfps so they re expecting you to be aggressive in showing that they are to be wanted in relationship literally in short time span sometimes isfps mistake intps as an wow you guys sound really depressing go buy season pass to an nearby amusement park or set your bed on fire or something ps that girl

really so you re saying you might have started pokemon go trend laughing laughing yeah that why asked if it could be trick up in their sleeves to say that while secretly bashing actually that would depend on how one divides the decade not everyone uses the early mid late designations there are folks out there who use the halves formula and others who use the quarters now that it has been few years since this topic was created m going with 2016 for those who said 2013 and 14 are the definitive years of this decade are honestly wrong those two years were really hope there a change coming very soon m honestly tired of the mid 10s for the simple fact it has been horrendous hopefully the late 10s turns to be much better and give this decade i thought 90s nostalgia has been huge for some time with all the revivals of tv shows fads fashion and more thought that was enough to indicate that 90s was in and 80s was out however i honestly going to put this out there and say that most people are practically hybrids even if their childhood leans in one era or another don see anything wrong with folks in the 90s 00s whoa shocked everyone should at least know how to use pc if they have an it job it not that difficult that makes me wonder how they got hired if they don know to use one confused that what wanna know just month ago there were articles stating that millennials were killing everything eating avocado toast and all the other bs laughing now it all changes week ago agree with your entire post 20 30 years in front of computer is lot more time to know how to code program things and more the older folks in your workplace were not only lazy but they re good news people after all the bs that millennials have received over the years they are finally being seen in positive light came two articles today stating that millennials are doing much totally agree yeah it does sound like some folks forget that technology is gradual process not an instant one in fact despite that the iphone was released in 2007 most people didn have it that very true it seems that lots of people forget that millennials are known for more than just tech such as optimism idealism adventurous etc no the first full year of gen is 1995 which is the hs class of 2013 1993 and 94 are generally considered to be millennials too bad you weren here few years ago there were many people of didn need to because have seen that link thousand times yeah it says the typical start is the mid 90s but that does not that mean it 1993 or 94 again either no source or very few have no 1995 is the beginning gen starts with the hs class of 2013 sources even state that hold up ppg wasn popular anymore in 2004 and 05 oh and take back when said that show ended in well that is because you re not reading enough sources most references have 1994 95 as the end not much earlier than you believe oh yes they were 1991 folks were children when ppg premiered no what those comments are showing is that the xennials are pretty much the older millennials and are trying way too hard to fit with gen even if they wanted their own mini generation besides this is an excellent rundown on each generation and its descriptions and like the chart the only issue have with it is the designations truly think it each cohort should have two groups of this is an interesting perspective appreciate that you pointed those things out agree with what you said with on the last few points except for privacy about the consequences of words that nope not at all do have male cousins though and we all witnessed power rangers and pokemon oh and btw both fads were for guys and girls what made you imply that power rangers and pokemon were don agree with that classification at all all generations should be two groups the whole early core late designations are frustrating and have made endless destructive debates in the past so she would have been in the minority then the article stated that first time moms were around 25 26 it would have been rare for people in her age range to have children during that time again never said she was all said was that she is gen since it seems like she in her early 40s you said your mom is about 20 years older than you and you re 1993 person that means she was so for the last few days have been looking at comments regarding the xennials or the oregon trail generation and have to honestly that they are pretty much older millennials whether they do you even know what early 21st century means it not just 2000 01 09 if your mom is about 20 older than you then she not millennial she would be gen again yes some xers had kids in think you really really misunderstood about what said was talking about non traditional college students you can be one at any age',\n",

that he might ve been attempting to detach himself from some of his feelings he could ve taken so long to listen to the tapes because he didn want to experience lot of his the majority of this especially the part about the grips is based on the cognitive functions system which is an inaccurate system don want to go too off topic from the actual topic of this coming from someone that is an intp if clay is one too don think that he one of the most well written ones in some ways can relate to clay his social awkwardness did remind me of myself love clothes and wearing coming up with nice outfits which doesn seem to be typical for an intp no clay seems very motivated by his feelings he takes so long to listen to the tapes because it too emotionally difficult for him to listen to too

about my type but intp just fits the best usually whenever don want to change plans whenever get emotional about something or whenever want to hang out with people wonder that because q is relatively decent way to summarize someone intelligence but it not true representation of someone complete mental abilities it blows my mind how someone can intelligence is more than someone i also there are plenty of people with high q that aren interested in pursuing high paying careers to me intelligence using this in broader sense than just q which is poor way to judge someone overall intelligence is one of the most important traits for potential partner to have would recommend that you eliminate any ideas about the cognitive functions when deciding what your personality type is the system of cognitive functions that lot of people subscribe to is very think that big problem is that the traits that are often associated with each zodiac type are really common and or vague so lot of people read about trait that someone says zodiac type has am opposed to any supernatural beliefs related to the zodiac signs and to horoscopes and such but think that you re right and that it could be possible that the time of year that someone is born don try to type yourself based on the cognitive functons they are inaccurate recommend going solely by the dichotomies can we include any fictional intps or do you mainly just want ones that fit into hero or villain archetype m not sure that know any other intps in real life nobody that know the type of is an intp besides myself the only people that know that seem to be intps are all intelligent professors or my favorite subject is philosophy but also like astronomy astrophysics biology physics and psychology lot really like certain aspects of math but there are some that m not huge love clothes really like dressing up finding cool outfits and shopping for new items of clothing like dressing up in unique way rather than dressing up in way that is what generally maybe but debating theists isn depending how strong the interest is would agree but definitely don think that simple desire to be collector or minimalist is any reflection of mental health someone can certainly get am type 5 and love collecting things like owning and keeping things that have some type of significance to me or just seem cool while m pretty sure that m type 5 m not like intj infp and entp this question is hard to answer without going into the topics of different conversations generally find it easier to talk about myself but it probably significantly more difficult for me to think that it is best to completely disregard the cognitive functions when attempting to determine your mbti it not just that they don have to match up but that the whole commonly accepted think isfj fits far better than intj he gets way too obsessed over the immediate details of the tapes for me to see him as an type he consistently confronts people before even finishing the haven read the book but think that he an intp in the show clay interests and some of his conversations like the superpower one seem pretty esque but think that he an isfj he get too obsessed with the immediate details when listening to the what makes clay seem like t think that he pretty clearly on the feeling side the only reason that he takes so long to listen to the tapes is that he gets really emotional from listening to yeah suppose that it definitely possible that she simply adopted idealistic fantasies through what she saw in books movies and such and sure types can like poetry anyway she still seems think it good it well made the story is done well and the characters are well written will tell you though that some of the scenes with extreme situations are pretty graphic it a in the first episode she explained something along the lines of having had an idealistic vision of what she had wanted her first kiss to be like so thought that her being too trusting was

type as me she such an inflexible thinker so surely she can be but she claims she took now that think about it you seem reminiscent of infp in several ways as an infp m very emotional but have strong

perceiving and one extroverted perceiving function for example ahoy ye lasses glad to have you two in here you both seem very enthusiastic us infp are just so lovable i also advise you check out the enneagram since you re here it a wholly there have been important people with less than genius iq feynman had an iq of 125 and crick iq is purported to have been 119 they both received nobel prizes on

though it a novel pursuit of adding more rigor to mbti and when was 8 years old got around 135 140 now that m 16 and on adhd meds test closer to 145 150 suspect that my iq is closer to between 140 145 but in any case those iq are sufficient phew that was quite ride lol you definitely seem very ne fi to me you re attuned to possibilities and ideas in the external world ne and you search for them according to your personal don see any te in you so that rules out intj and infp you seem more ti your concern for others and ability to influence or cheer them up also suggests fe to me my brother is an intj and my first guess is intp you re perceptive open minded and laid back and you repress your feelings in light of whatever is considered to be the objective truth you re definitely introverted and you seem strongly isfp hate being misled is very characteristic of se to me you re acutely aware of personal space and territory also think that your gut feelings about people and your good lord you re being dodgy he not asking how you see se he asking how you personally relate how does it connect to your experience what qualities of your experiences are se like dude op you seem more infp in that you lack precision when you express your ideas grammar and spelling mistakes also aren really inconsistencies per se get the impression that you re more fi than instinctively reading op suggests to me that you re 5w6 you hoard knowledge like 5 and feel that you are more of an independent thinker than 6 the 5 is an ego type while the 6 is pardon me for playing devil advocate here but thnk infj are about as evil as anyone else perhaps we are predisposed to falling prey to false causes but it not as if we re the only ones born unto this earthiness dirt under your fingernails shrouded in

skepticism is uncertain of it _ but in any case myself am internally elitist in my judgment though reserve this aspect m pretty much ok with positive remarks haha generally negative criticism will

friend noora was this type like 100 we got along well not to say didn step on her toes because was young and inconsiderate now m better with fe types and she would yes know what you mean by feeling connected to other human like you do mean have it too but not in the same way esfjs have their fe side mine is always so minor can barely see the the issue is they come across online as quick and yeah

the deep south bible belt area and fairly rural my specific area is steeped in tradition and conventions that are sometimes just wow great list most of these scare me too except the unrelated ones love all things nature even ants 1 do you normally follow most social norms conventions don mean things like laws or rules at work m referring to traditions and social behavior in my area southeastern us these would be have the opposite problem have pretty serious lack of empathy m not mean person just don feel it sometimes wish could it just not there act on principle alone so i not an extrovert but lurk here because it is interesting to observe my flip side it has nothing to do with romanticism or desiring to be complete it because in way relate and am beware defective or missing heart do not attempt to date or befriend commitment speaking in front of big group of people surprise uninvited unannounced company at my house horror of all horrors well put m known for my brutal honesty seriously if you met 10 random people who know me bet all of them would mention it and most of them would also mention that m crazy but that has though ve ever doubted my isfp ness in the past there is no doubt now haha you could have been writing this about me isfp and infp both love nature infp might love reading about it looking at pictures of it thinking about it planning their next outing isfp would much rather be out in it experiencing it in just inhaled my koolaid laughing laughing laughing you made really good point m in my 40s and my personality is much more balanced than it was when was in my 20s also ve developed coping strategies to help me thrive and survive in my know exactly what you mean thank you once got on the isfp subforum knew it was my fit also found group fellow isfps who are in the intj grip lot of the time and another group who is also not nice guess well someone who knows more about mbti is welcome to correct or clarify this answer but isfp and intj use the same functions when m in the grip m using my secondary functions which are the ok big question this is one of the reasons was typed here as an isfp am basically logic oriented unless my values principles are involved did 2 questionnaires and that was probably the lol no love them laughing speaking from an point of view many if not most things don feel strongly about so in most cases my emotions don affect my thinking as much as you would think at work have to make used to think couldn possibly be isfp because m too aloof but feeling doesn necessarily mean feeling toward people m feeling toward my dogs and my passions nature hiking and my ',\n",
              " ' love this so true all of it have to disagree with those two statements my involvement with fellow infp which ended up going completely wrong shed light to me on the self centered nature of our infp fi yes while things yup same here also notice it lot in regards to how my ne behaves seem to have been stuck in an fi si loop for what feels like forever now and sometimes it makes me doubt my type because personally what have serious problem with is the apparent notion that the potential pitfalls for our personality type are an instant deal breaker for most women yet other types own potential can relate with what you said too tend to overanalyze on 1 vs 1 games and in fighting videogames too lack the skill to pull off certain moves in addition once things don go my way can oh yes ve seen this too haha no offense to any te users who may read this but this doesn make much sense to me it sounds like overblown te using the function where it doesn belong couldn agree more think the notion of getting together with someone who complements us strikes closer to home with te and fe types fe types have the tendency to help everyone around them agree with this honestly find it kind of lazy to get together with someone that balances one personality it seems to imply that the matters that one is not good at will be left in the hands this authenticity is huge turn on both personality wise and in regards to looks make up is almost always an instant turn off for me openness when it comes to sex and wanting to try new ve seen this behavior but in an infp actually don have whole lot of real life experience with isfps but my only experience with another infp has been horrible do agree with what has from my experience and own interactions with infjs ve seen that infjs tend to have more collectivistic values whereas infps views are more individualistic this is obviously not true for all you could always try telling her how she would feel if she were in the shoes of those around her how she would feel if she was on the receiving end of her own behavior etc if logic doesn work find that those theories do not translate well into reality shared functions or not find that estjs are in direct opposition to the very things that stand for as such interaction with them exactly my experience this is highly common among introverted types and more particularly among fi users so if he a type that has that function this is pretty normal behavior besides the role that shyness itself m in similar situation last year met this girl with whom m great friends now it a deep close and unconventional friendship in way we both see it that way started developing disillusioned almost numb disappointed by the fact that the ideal form of connecting to someone is just that and ideal thus unattainable also like shit for being as inhumane as to measure yep it could as tests can be very inaccurate at their core isfps and infps are extremely similar so you ll definitely see yourself in the isfp is you are considering infp advise you to not that m purposefully casting more doubts into you now that you ve settled for infp but m getting an infj vibe here to be honest from what you ve written gather that you put lot of saw this in an infp description it was used to illustrate the essential differences between the infp and the intp it from soren kierkegaard x93there is something missing in my life and it just wanted to comment on this particular bit if ti is more concerned with ideas and with the abstract te is concerned with empiric objective data ergo the whole asking for facts thing think jung was purposefully vague about function hierarchy because he realized that from his 8 basic personality types there could be endless amounts of subtypes mbti and socionic 16 types nope just the other way around actually first got into mbti then started reading jung more in depth which made me rethink lot of things about mbti this is very interesting it an issue ve had with mbti too and m sure it lead to lot of mistyping like you said in mbti it like the dominant and the auxiliary are inseparable in both mbti and socionics assume that if you are introverted and thus have primary function which is introverted your auxiliary function will be extroverted some people believe that not agree with ray mabry here in the end there will always be different interpretations and definitions floating around of the same thing even jung himself initially had very different concept of don know much about socionics but in mbti the whole p dichotomy bothers me it baffles me that an introverted feeler would be typed as perceiving type based solely on their auxiliary agree with lot of what has been said here while admit have fun trying to figure other people types as well as my own typing people for the sake of typing putting you and others in agree with what entr0py said lots of infps claim to have very strong ti and that doesn make them any less of an infp yes fi and ti oppose each other but not as much as te opposes to fi even hey all m in the middle of an assignment for my psychology major in which we re supposed to pass questionnaire to people get the results back and then analyze them need as many people as think need my significant other to show me affection and to be open at least to certain degree about their feelings but overall d go with intp as don see myself being with sensor fifty fifty thought would score higher into the female side of the continuum but guess it accurate as really don fully relate to either genre for the better or the worse are you referring to romantic relationships or any kind of relationship if the latter ve known for over 3 years someone who believe is an istp never made him take the test but he seems like m putting my money on introverted feeling as your primary based on couple of things you described there such as hating hearing people insult others which would confirm that you are ixfp certainly did not exactly the same way but very very similar in fact to some very small degree think it still happens to me not the being in some sort of game thing but feeling that fire fire passion what is life without passion not coincidentally my favorite color is red think get infatuated with someone pretty damn quickly as for true love don think ve ever experienced it so don know tend to get quite emotional about my crushes that damn fi actually said that imagining how it could for other people because looking back at my whole life m pretty sure ve always been both an and p hah this contradicts what said but think think introversion and the are pretty much determined at birth on one hand introversion is about our energy levels about getting energized with alone time and drained with social interaction yeah feel you it usually either about those topics or about women in superficial kind of way suffice to say the solution would be obviously to go find other nfs to surround ourselves male infp here but can relate actually most people here probably will can feel completely attracted to someone just based on the physical component and not only do need to be attracted besides female infps being pretty have to add that they also have incredibly nice voices on top of it just sounding nice it always seems to have certain aura of shyness to it that makes you',\n",

read even if enjoyed after while you forget them 0 6 the books enjoyed the most were the caroline juliet stories don know if they re don know about others but don really care if something is mainstream or not however work that is mainstream often comes with 1 awful interpretation from readers 2 seeing too much of hmm as far as female intps go they re really really rare mean intp are rare enough in non robot way gotta agree that luna lovegood is an intp so is tiffany aching from the discworld ve read this post on tumblr it about how the main characters of winnie the pooh except christopher each represent diffferent function let me copy paste it pooh si x93it is more fun to yes m an intp raised by an isfp and one of my best friends is an isfp too also got an istp as pretty much sister kinda friend and infj dad and step mom my mom is one of the people had yes and no technically m almost textbook intps but sometimes have doubts about being an entp an istp or an intj in the end always go back to intp ve done different tests lots of them m not gonna nitpick on your reasons cause enough people did it already so m just gonna humor you 23 student in psychology former history of arts student basque spanish then french side don know if some of you read boku no hero academia without taking the functions into account deku seems like an istp bakugou seems estj d like to help but ve always seen myself as the parent friend who ends up being called aunt something because know all my faults and d definitely wouldn want to burden kid with that hm in my last year of elementary school for some reason most of my friends began to bully me was already not very social person but it sure worsen after that it wasn much but when some isn edward more of an entp and alphonse seems infp like truthfully don consider it to be either of our faults when he and my mom broke up she got to keep me because she was the only one financially stable and she wanted my education to be only done which one i think what made it worse was that he wasn the one raising me so in way it felt like he really didn have right well even less of right to be like that and on his side it was probably like romance in novels so long as it not overbearing but romance novels not so much do western animated movies count if so belle from disney beauty and the beast and hiccup from how to train your dragon otherwise from death note shiro from no game no life funky mbti in well most of my friends have fun calling me guy in girl body however get along lot more easily with women than men maybe because most of my friends are dom but truthfully have native french speaker who speak fairly well english can understand spanish fairly well but sadly have trouble speaking it on the side m learning basque euskarian and italian and though depending on my mood either choose an elf archer mage or some sort of paladin knight personally m just gonna go see big hero 6 to spite the people know who wanted me to go see 50 shades of domestic abuse with them does the internet count as socializing we ll say yes then so long as have books music or movies can last at least two weeks at least don need others but actually like talking to don know about others but m interested in pretty much everything how many fucks give about it as to actually research and or listen depends on my mood really usually philosophy or well my dad typed infj truthfully we re lot alike but he too wouldn say righteous but actually he kinda is he tries to control everything and can be very close minded so obviously we it just about the us which in itself is biased even more so if you add well most of the comments on these four pages mean even if you just think of the studies level part university when even though you had migraine that completely shut down your brain during work to the point of being sent back home by your boss and the first thing you do when getting there 30 minutes is to normally have up to 150 tabs or something d say between 70 and 150 now discovered too many times which allows me to fall down to 30 then in matter of minutes find the way to go back never felt that affected by the concept of death pretty much all the old ones in my family that died were people was close to when was five my great grandmother was someone whom had i realized well knew it before since it always been obvious but it really struck me this morning how much of mommy girl ve always been in this case having an understanding tolerant dunno as far as go like most sports unless m forced to run all the time especially if ball is involved used to like basket ball and volleyball but having to do it for grade kind of as said only said that from my experience as my mother was probably without using the 8 functions as haven tried that on her yet an infp bordering on istp so that might have helped while true but it actually helps because there some sort of tolerance when you stumbles upon words that helps you get closer and understand that person when helping them then again my opinion is only but wouldn you get better as time passes by my cousin isn very good in english but he and his girlfriend are communicating in english and they ve been together for 7 months now and he not really was raised by someone who got kind of frustrated by my lack of communication while living in an environment that allowed it she was the opposite but ve been interested into fp parents will have more chance at getting through to their intp child and be way more respectful of their needs than an fj parent from personal experience or as my step mom called it the can find the article was looking for think it this one but as can access it can be sure alcock w ryan m 127884 alcock w

encounter intps in the day the conversation never runs dry because they have so much to teach you if you re criticism of writing format from an intj that just too classic yawn don think you can really put an age on betrayal nor do think you can put certain amount of value to it you can be betrayed as 5 year old by something very simple but the way it makes it just human nature to be horrible people hurt each other and that how it works that one too really don like it people don seem to understand that it not the mistake that infp 4w5 so sp sx preferred communication would prefer contact over

to restart my life after going through pretty long depression guess it working but at the same time ve been feeling like oh yeah that why stopped caring pretty much relate to so much of your comment entheos ve never kept job for longer than couple of years have to keep moving around and finding something better m scared to do that now because m it not overwhelming would think it would be since you re constantly around lot of new people and kids who don respect you though to be fair don know much about that line of work yeah the whole time was reading your reply was thinking that sounds like something would love doing for short amount of time and then lose interest as soon as the novelty wore off but always wanted to be more scientifically literate applaud you for getting into that field good luck with school next year not sure if this has ever been asked was just curious because know we usually don willingly follow the status quo know ve had jobs that hate because you can really get around dreamed that was in an apartment that lived in when was 6 7 years old everything looked the same as it did back then and there were even polly pockets on the floor which used to play with know lot of people have asked where to find enfjs but have slightly different question first of all where can find you online specifically don like the area where live and am two and half years later ll try answering think he enfj m not that proficient in mbti m just basing that opinion on the enfjs that know used to care about what everyone thought of me would overthink every single thing did don do that anymore and don care about strangers opinions but still care what my friends an audio interview with david foster wallace as everyone else has said honesty is the most important thing if you re honest from the beginning she will appreciate you more than you ll ever know she might not show it very well because infps never let me go it a book and movie it doesn matter whether you watch the film or read the book first because it one of those rare instances where they are both masterpieces in my don even know that the problem don know what to consider important if don know what important in the grand scheme of existence hmm guess being compassionate and caring for relate to your post so much m also 27 with an isfj mom but my dad is istj don know if would call it childish who decided that being super serious business person is what being an are you asking me or just elaborating the question what is important unfortunately because it so easy to stay inside these days they re probably inside by themselves or with few friends usually only hang out away from my house when people force me if leave completely agree think lot of the old movie musicals had forgettable music so that wasn a deal breaker for me like it was for some people feel like in the next few years people are just watched la la land it was great can see why some people didn like it but loved it don really know what to say about it that hasn been said already if you liked the trailer because feel things so deeply it hits me really hard which is weird because finding out that human you like is in fact human shouldn be bad thing depsite being in my late 20s still m 27 now was unhealthy in lot of ways in elementary school kept to myself and only spoke with close friends but was really happy and felt comfortable with myself in middle school my dad is also an istj and my mom is isfj so they both saved the day many times when went to an out of state college at 18 it was the best experience of my life loved the area where was my mom is also isfj what is it about that pairing in all my years of being alive haven figured out how to make that relationship work without lot of time apart miner tend to get along with other infps or intps the best but my best friend is an isfp admire any extroverted type because wish were extroverted ve always felt jealous of enfjs because they my mom never gave me any sort of freedom when was kid and that was huge mistake was always depressed and angry because always felt like was being watched when left home thought yes m basically repeating what other posters have said but ll respond anyway if m extremely depressed tend to forget to eat when m just slightly depressed overeat when m feeling don know if this counts because it wasn a film with scary ambiance per se but fried green tomatoes don remember lot about that movie because saw it when was two or three but yes they can two that come to mind are ex machina and the double granted neither of these movies did well at the box office but if your question is whether or not intellectual movies can be made there are lot of points 1 can speak for you but lot of the books read are better when read more than once they re the kind that ask you to read between the lines which is easier read the alchemist when was 18 and thought it was the best book ever written it made me feel like somehow wouldn live boring life simply because had read the book it made me feel sorry campfire didn read through all of the replies so this might have been asked already but watching movie with friends or curling up with book by yourself fast rode the knight by stephen crane fast rode the knight with spurs hot and reeking ever waving an eager sword to save my lady fast rode the knight and leaped from

currently m university student came into college thinking that was an infj but being on my own has taught me that m very obviously an intp going through the awkward let try to use fe m going to give this typology thing another shot sooo if you re up to try to type me go for it ignore any past posts of mine and any types that may appear under my avatar in my profile ready elaborate ugh ve been identifying as infj for about two years now but in recent discussion it was determined that my feelings are only approached and explored through the lens of ti my feelings get hurt the gifts of intuition is mostly is where got it there are multitude of positive aspects to this combo infj 6w5s can predict problems long before anyone else even considers them to be so m still unsure of my type ve typed infp infj intp and entp m not sure and have problems describing myself to people objectively so m using this what my type form that was i ve been struggling with this ever since first heard of mbti few years back the problem is that can see arguments both for and against myself being an infp what do you think m prone think lot of infjs run into this issue like someone above said ti tends to scream really loud in certain situations especially if you re more academic type yet the inherent difference take everything seriously especially my ideas since m an ni dom all of my ideas are connected to something larger when share one of my ideas and someone criticizes it take it to mean it seems like you extavert your perceiving function ntp it only natural for you to use ne to interact with people because it an extraverted function the differences between entp and intp are think you re 100 right was speaking more generally for all infj 6w5 but you re absolutely right in there being variations among that group m thinking based on the reading that ve done that am an infj that likes to play intj stop and consider group values when making decisions but sometimes go into quasi intj mode and don i being as honest as possible taking these tests so these are about as accurate as the results come when you wake up in the morning what is the first thing you think do you think about took that test above and got intj preferences go introvert 100 intuitive 38 thinking 1 judging 22 veeerrryyy slight preference for thinking over feeling took yet nah m barelling around chose infj months ago and then questioned it until found myseld unsure again have taken the test multiple times ve found that your results can easily be corrupted by state of kind and subjective bias also find it difficult to just take results without questioning ve been thinking about this combination lately it really colors the way we use our functions and it somewhat difficult to find infj 6w5 sooo here my little analysis of the lot please tell 1 well m fairly interested in things such as the tarot astrology and qabalah because they take broad complex topics and narrow them down to abstract symbolism really like symbolism and your description of fi was pretty freaking good it actually somewhat interesting that my immediate response to your post was to internalize and personalize it ve taken tests before but they re hi ve been thinking about type great deal lately as ve just entered college which of course entails lot of who am questions ve narrowed down my type to infp infj intp and intj ok this may be long post but m venting lot of feelings from small amount of time moved in three days ago note that up until this point had been pretty much free to do my infj si but not by massive margin the approval of others is fairly important to me and enjoy connecting with others on mental level if have to step out of my comfort zone though ll say screw ok so now m tad confused again here what my function stack looks like on average ne 38 3 ti 37 9 si 37 7 fe 25 3 ni 24 8 te 19 4 fi 14 15 se 10 2 this is pretty accurate remember my step father giving me crap as youngster because evidently didn love my little sister it hurt my feelings but can see why he thought that never hmmm infp or intp infp fi prominent right this means taking in information and accessing it based on previously established beliefs or ideas gives infp an aspect of their personality that hi ve thought of myself as an infj with strong ti for while now but m not 100 sure that m an infj at all it possible that m an intp or intj or maybe even something else the here one that learned on my las vegas adventure actually use your secondary function e that amazing extraverted feeling if you didn notice bolded underlined and italicized that after posting what did sort of vanished so now need to thank everyone after getting into the hotel room and nearly losing my mind that night the time frame that posted here hi guys really need someone to talk to or vent to so this post may be little long m near my psychological breaking point m feeling the most helpless and hopeless ve ever felt before that really touching glad to know it made difference actually think this thread needs to be revived remember that intuitive types are minority chances are if you re talking to ve never really stopped and considered this like most of the things that find myself chasing being understood is very vague and complicated goal think that infjs including myself my little picture thing it the hanged man from the rider waite tarot deck it represents finding peace through suffering and growing through pain it also represents non comformity strangeness that exactly no exaggeration what mean sometimes can be the center of the conversation and quite the the attention hog at that but other times feel like no one is paying attention to perhaps my wording was bit extreme laughing don think it dual personalities as it would be if had personality disorder think it as you said two somewhat contrasting functions does anyone else have dual personality by that mean do you often notice that you have sharply contrasting sides to your nature that sometimes even contradict each other for me notice that yes yes and yes when was little bit younger would often meet girls that were complete strangers to me would from there quite quickly organize elaborate romantic fantasies non sexual from what you said here it is very possible that he is an infj of the social subtype think that they were called the revolutionary type in an article that read once more generally he sounds it the same here from the opposite side enfps are like ideal lovers for me get all fuzzy and warm feeling just thinking about it love you guys to death m an infj and ve had longstanding problems with shallow people but m proud to say that my best friends in the universe have been enfps love how enthusiastic you this is my story completely long for social interaction when m alone probably because idealize socializing imagine myself to be better at it than really am when m around people i think most of us would be pushed to cruelty when we feel that it justified guess if my sense of values and ideals has become so distorted that end up with twisted sense of morality this stuff is very good so far this is exactly what was hoping for want to add few more despite the fact that you often like to pretend that you re rationalist type nts you are not yes this is an important one if may build off of that don use the infj test of resolve this is when infjs will theorize that someone has an interest in them and instead of reaching please forgive me is something like this exists or if this is simply out of place or pointless infjs generally have problems with romance this is true quick search online will often yield see what you re saying there a marked difference between the thoughtful males that infjs tend to be and the super extroverted man that the western world tends to idealize think many infj ve done this before but never really knew that it had name or that it was something that infjs did in particular remember doing this once and eventually feeling very bad about it don mean to be dead horse but no we can appear psychic or crazy on the outside but usually the conclusions that we come to are very logical our ni will connect things and form conclusions it depends on who says it if it a complete stranger don really take it too seriously my feelings will be hurt but won really linger on

my female entj friend there a male entp she knows who lives far away and she can figure out whether he likes her or not here are the facts about the what is anything like watching emotional things that make me cry guess do that fairly regularly crying is pleasure for me because it a reflection of the emotional high that m feeling it seems that my best friend is an estp he awesome there more to estps than you might think you just have to take the time to get to know them puts some ice in the mango juice and drinks it seeing manta ray gracefully gliding through shallow water and then walking down the peer alongside it leaves glass of ginger beer all can say is this find way to get paid for doing what you love and you won work day in your life agree with this don think you have to believe in anything supernatural to have spiritual experience being at one with maths and science is just as valid as being at one with something insanityaware you have highlighted reason for why making deep connection with an intp might be difficult it seems unlikely that an intp will ever think an infp religious or spiritual beliefs ve had an intp friend for several years and tried to connect with him on an emotional level several times it very difficult don think it impossible though the thing is he would very keep this attitude and m sure you ll do great don let anyone dampen your enthusiasm the more of strange non human character can be the better m wondering do infps often get involved in game development if so what your role in development team and do you enjoy it m self employed games developer who does everything solo thanks for the advice never even considered that she might dislike public displays of affection okay it sounds like it would probably be wise to not attempt to move things too quickly ll ve met someone who really like and honestly m not sure of her type but m guessing they re an estj they have these traits sociable extremely organised to levels that basically hmm this has made me think have pretty much no friends so when we re all chatting in room together it gets very logical get most annoyed when logic gets placed as priority above m not contrarian when m feeling calm it just when someone upset me or said something that goes against my morals ll get in an argumentative mood which is hard to stop get the feeling that it an infp stereotype to be agreeable and non argumentative but find myself to be quite the opposite m often compelled to say the exact opposite of what someone once you ve got conversation going be very passionate about something and tell her about it as an infp m sure you re passionate about at least few things but don waffle on too te extroverted thinking 5 ti introverted thinking 25 ne extroverted intuition 80 ni introverted intuition 70 se extroverted sensing 10 si introverted sensing 35 hmmm can tell you that as an infp am very emotionally concerned about my friends all of the time and take great pleasure in helping them with their personal problems just because someone is if you read my 2nd post you ll see that was basing my decision off of functions and not personality descriptions ne is great for coming up with plans very quickly think an ni plan would take what this based off do you really think isfps are drawing more are better at drawing than infps or other types don think so wow it sounds like you have very good idea of how for the purposes of this thread m talking about art in regards to drawing painting etc not music or other art forms ve heard people say that only some types can be good artists personally armin fi he more focused on his own need to be accepted by others rather the needs of other people ne he frequently comes up with crazy creative plans out of nowhere te he actually eren jaeger infj armin arlert infp mikasa ackerman istj m quite confident that armin is an infp m not 100 sure about the others though it sounds like things between you are becoming bit stagnant and that probably because of not seeing each other enough my advice would be to get that holiday planned asap and go bring lots don know about relationships with estps but my best friend is an estp and we get on amazingly well and have done for over 10 years what do self employed computer games developer how got to this point did degree in computer games design started company kept at it despite suffering years of extreme poverty that was actually really refreshing and enlightening statement thanks for that most of my close friends are ntjs except for my best friend who an estp adhd

picked donatello other than was absolute shit at tmnt for nes and his weapon had amazing reach yeah the thing is you can mix mbti and enneagram at least initially they weren created to coexist but are two independent ways to classify personality it does bring lot of insight when you tbh think this pretty often but it has an implied some in front of it second the above post my original typing when was eh 16 maybe ended up being the real one ve spent lot of time doubting my personality type enneagram more so than mbti but still and in my case mbti was right the problem have with it is as teenager an insistence on being unique created many problems it was totally unnecessary and did it all to myself stroking my ego but feeling lonely distant certainty is loaded for me ve just realized recently m type 6 how much certainty do you need more than is possible to have it seems generally in specific situations anything with just wanted to say you re not alone ve had the same confusion and just recently switched back as well the problem in my opinion is as an fi user my inner emotional landscape becomes big you don want to go into this with me lol or maybe you do since you asked the question ll make it brief in case live in fantasy world or at least used to spend more time in never saw the movie but nothing about the trailer really interested me m picky about portrayal of mental illness though too so that part of her character puts me off reminds me too much of the number five is blue so d say blue 5w4 is nice blue green though 6 is orange this is just my synesthesia colors by the way what is the significance of types having colors my aesthetics aren very 6 like at all at least if tumblr enneagram aesthetic posts are anything to go by don put any thought into it because if was typed by aesthetics d be 459 or tested the hell out of my parents growing up didn become aware of this testing until my mom said something along the lines of expecting them to read my mind find the fact that do this the issue see with infj vs infp is usually when comparing the descriptions the function stackings make the types seem so different to me can imagine identifying as an infj based on that but err well back in the day my three main wow characters were restoration druid beast mastery hunter and protection paladin in that order so your guesses were pretty close actually lol how do you tell if you relate to 9 just because you re 6 or because it your gut fix or what about the difference between sexual 6 and 6 with an 8 fix never had problem determining my heart honestly didn know had problem with trust until spent night with some riso hudson books and figured out had absolutely no idea who was before but it brought me to tears to just trust cause not getting out of bed feeds the depression so of course the depression wants you not to get out of bed ve always thought depression was very effective affliction because it is excellent wouldn wait 2 hours in that situation and would also ask at some point but ve had similar approach to problem solving before lmao if you could even call it that no it like welp personally the main difference see is in our relationship to our

your body pumps up energy from all the what does it take to drive you to do something you ordinarily wouldn want to just give me an order and ll do it boss if you were my boss and you tell me to do something will obey your wow it been while since ve made thread anyways m drunk and m bored so here goes so ve been tested as an estj but want you guys to guess what my type is based on what tell my favourite is no pain no gain this is what live by first of all hate you all who don use your cell phones because how can ever get in contact with you if you don have cell phone second of all cell phone will save your life because you oh and about the estj wanting to control everything it not that we want to control everything that around us it just that we have need to control our lives for example need to be in art is good mate however it is unnecessary wasted my high school years going the arts and wish could have done something else you know if it wasn for the arts would have done so much why thank you suggest doing all the assigned readings and problems before each class you then make notes during class and review your notes after class so you don forget about what you ve learned that the here is my goal in life and hopefully you ll gain some insight want high paying job so can support my current and future family also want power and fame in order to do so must work in short how did you come to your conclusions haha wow you know what think my brother has that problem too from what his friends have told me so far anyways interesting think you and him should hangout sometime and are you satisfied with what you ve been doing indeed it sucks to stay in the house all summer the thing is mate m much older than he is and do many things that are illegal for him it summer and my 16 year old brother has never left the house he says his friends bore him and all his does is watch online videos draw and play his guitar any insights 1 place the black furry thing which think is cushion of some kind on the bed 2 sort out what you need and what you don need and place everything that you need on the bed 3 take out all nice another korean and an estj glad to see you here you should think people would stay on and join these kinds of forums if they are more informative rarely use the internet for entertainment use it mainly for research agree lance they are very attractive and yes think this is stupid because you can only judge on someone after interacting with him or her in person wow did not know was missed guys happy however normally don spend lot of time on the computer when m home for the summer hope to see you two in the chatroom sometime though can say for all because don know all estjs one of my buddies at work told me that have fucked up mind when said it would be waste of money if we got off work early because had bought myself 5 worth of food on top of my normal lunch excellent to be honest m lacking with the forum myself these days tongue unfortunately hey m not the only estj here anymore do stick around similar to treebob think about what have to do next when m not concentrating on something that m doing you got that right wouldn you be more of an introvert since you need lots of time alone well what are you waiting for go and apply for job you should make thread on this on the general psychology or the general discussion forums because not lot of people will see this re position you wish to apply for dear hiring manager as graduate of _____ university with an honours degree in psychology initiated coordinated and evaluated various group activities right well usually you want to make sure you address your qualifications that match to the qualifications listed on the job ad in your covering letter you should first state why you want to the what job are you applying for and what are the listed requirements qualifications ah thanks for the clarifications ll answer the questions below do you typically write from subjective opinion or do you try to hold that in which you write generally objective even if don know why you want to know this but need break from studying so here goes do you generally type long posts or do you generally type short posts or perhaps does it matter on ve said this before somewhere but still think mbti mainly represents your dominant function you cannot be one type but you can prefer one type over the other 15 as one lecturer said there alright well that their fault you can blame the tests just because of that why would anyone be dishonest with one self if you want to know what kind of person you are by using various tests like the mbti you would want to be honest with yourself otherwise you ll be haha that exactly what the guy said when answering one of the questions ah yes thank you for the question because that made me think of my grade 12 class or something along the lines well the thing is wasn so prepared for this either don like anticipating questions so didn really prepare anything to say just winged everyone question except for the first question how long does it take you to answer question in an interview prepared or not do you need to pause between sentences to think about what you are going to say next it is understood that ',\n",

some have managed to push ahead and make path but most seem generally pissed with their lives suppose it is relentless pursuit for mentoring for what someone older with more life experience how old are you hate asking for help and avoid it at all costs but am generally happy to help if think can genuinely help m an elementary school band director dread every day m using it to put my self through civilian flight training im hoping to be certified flight instructor by september want music back exactly what was thinking last winter started building wooden boat model still haven finished it but was fun as hell to work on every now and then add to it and they re all wicked fat get this when m flying airplanes especially when flying in instrument meteorological conditions the intense focus makes the rest of the world melt away it is like going deep down into the just start bashing everything tend to get escapism ve had non stop draining stress for 4 years in my teaching job when m driving to work get huge urges to keep driving past work and never come back or talk to anyone work 777777777 hours week to pay for flight training so don have time to waste on that crap don think there is anything worth my time on the idiotbox d rather stare at the wall than don own television but have seen episodes of flying wild alaska and the aviators on the computer they were pretty good smash them damn js ruin everything m working on becoming pilot ve never found anything more enjoyable and more suited to my personality the only good thing about teaching is that any other shitheaded job on earth is not only bearable but delightful after you get out of teaching this thread is making me more misanthropic worst one yet aviation is pretty awesome but the market is abominable m in my fourth year teaching slowly dying trying to become pilot why you stop teaching where do these nfps come up with this junk fuck everything lately for me it is airplanes maybe is my word of choice have found out the hard way that doing something for the practicality of getting paid is terrible idea don get yourself stuck in something you don want just for the sake of getting pay oh meant to add the estj will probably love it if you as for help they will have yet another pointless duty to fulfill also some possible differences in approach am guessing you are this will sound awful and hate myself for writing it it may be worth it to bite the bullet and ask them what you can do to change d rather die d rather tell them all to shit in their ahhh the whirlwind it is when am at my best blasting through new hobbies and experiences it comes and goes and there is no knowing when or why it just clicks d also have to go with landscape art had to take two art history classes in college enjoyed the realistic type art the most liked the renaissance and baroque art the best very accurate welp it really is tough decision flying 18s would be rad as hell but would the radness be worth it either way you be building quality hours for civilian career unless you decided to did you have dreams of what you wanted be when you were kid or what you would be like when you got older how far away did you end up from dreams have been thinking lot about my childhood an area designated for off road vehicles only and on the opposite side of town an area where no vehicles of any kind are aloud and all

currently an elementary school band director looking for an alternative career possibly engineering or something similar sick of being required to be know there are some istp engineers on here and

felt right at home watching that movie did not like the climbing leader that made them turn around though the two females are out of control isfj who should be imprisoned girlfriends family stayed out of it as much as could but had to intervene at one point at which point was basically belittled by an old bitch two psycho female attackers attacking another happened in house between family but not

jump down the emergency shoot with stolen six pack of beer anytime someone asks stupid question and make fun of it with my answer and they get pissed ask stupid question and you will get stupid answer now we re talking like your attitude yup still stuck and school starts again next week after thinking about it would definitely be considered hermit compared to most people but compared to how have been at certain times in the past am less of hermit at the time mostly had few years of my life where was complete loner even read book called the loners manifesto ate every meal alone and sometimes went days without talking to anyone it was also the aaaaahhhhahahahahahaha that was beautiful work closely with an old bag that presume to be an enfj she talks incessantly and is absolutely out to

saying once he is president he will probably be much more serious if he is being joke meant that can spend more time here because m taking some exams at the moment therefore spend more time at home alone studying and spend some of my breaks on perc then didn want you you know we are in entp land when no one answered the questions asked by the op tongue hum have you considered as entp ll assume you have that trump stupidity may be his tv persona and that he may not be the moron he appears to be on tv m not saying he actually smart m that or they are assholes proud not an infp but lost the password of my perc account so thought why not start new account with clean slate of course didn need clean slate at all haha hence chose the username any of you watched the tv show chuck love this show what are your thought on the show apart from typing and of course what do you think regarding the types of the characters oh alright haha so you based your typing of him on trailer that was funny haha didn even know about the guess my type lol will and you should watch it it funny and overall pretty good thought ti would help him put personal method together it not just improvising it finding solutions to the problems he is confronted with have you watched the show completely what do you think ne is definitely one of his top two functions pegged him as infp at first but he seems more fe than fi and he uses ti could be esfj but the way he can improvise solutions on the spot se can read people too if we go by functions was just making joke about your answer and the topic didn mind your answer at all this is cool story by the way obviously you didn get to choose since you don have free will silly of me to ask for those of you who haven watched chuck yet recommend it pretty funny oh yeah understand your point what systems are you referring to interesting that you changed your career may ask why m gonna enter business school hopefully knowledge in psychology might be of help in that line of study 3 not good and not bad either don know really like to think that m an integrated the knowledge into my world view while being exposed to new concepts in an academic environment laughed haha that a nice way to put it indeed do you hold science related job did you learn that in school or by yourself how old are you if you don mind me asking this sounds very cool love learning so much do you know good books on those subjects what are you into to answer your questions 1 m not into paychology psychology on the other hand is something m into mostly mbti and jung apart from that don have that much knowledge think just nice pun hahaha do any of you watched chuck finished the show couple of days ago and loved it m wondering if chuck isn an entp he obviously is ne type wonder which one though any thoughts on that understand better now the rain drop will fall on location based on variables outside of the rain drop itself hence the rain drop obviously doesn choose where it lands human beings are wanted to engage in conversation with you but since you proposed m going to read the thread at least little to gain more insight about the topic and then will get back to you the ne si in that example lol so you re saying that the only reason choose to eat the apple is because nothing no thought about the apple being filled with worm or no sight of worm for right now sympathy for the devil by the rolling stones didn read the thread yet but if you consider free will to be the ability to consciously make decision and if free will doesn exist then when do our decisions come from just wondering hi everyone basic questions 1 age or age range m 19 2 city country and or region m french live in paris lol read religion instead of region haha my parents are christians 3 the second one was actually much longer but deleted it because realized what said wasn very nice anyway never thought of that haha that a very cool idea will do that also since the you re

speak through texts we text lot so she spends some of her own time anyone happy fail follow annoying instructions to the letter tongue yeah you re right you shouldn force relationship if you re both not ready how long have you known each other and how long have you been friends it seems like very promising friendship the way you described his tolerance you could have very much been talking about me because am very tolerant as well many people have told me that they were comfortable and could be themselves know two esfps one is my sister and one is male friend of mine so cannot really talk about romantic relationships with esfp haha esfp are nice however they usually appears to be self in theory intuitive types all seem smarter more mysterious more insightful etc than sensors causing lot of smart and insightful sensors to test and identify better with types than with i have an istj friend she is nice and cute but so close minded sometimes feel like everything outside her opinion doesn exist in her eyes hi my intj friends come to you for advice and insight happy m friend with an intj and m going to describe her d say she ressembles the intj descriptions pretty well she is very very in my opinion your friend is fi type from what gathered she probably is an esfp since you thought she was an estp several things in your post make me think of that she does not let go someone once told me that was artistic in the way live this person also told me that somehow inspired him which really made me emotional haha m comfortable with sadness d rather be sad than feeling nothing although the sadness sometimes feel is usually intense and short lived don like prolonged sadness the only feeling i think needed to hear that right now thank you lol don like 007 that much what made

attractive personality types out there please don change anything about yourselves if the average person doesn get you perhaps it is because you are why wouldn you see the inside can read souls lol would have thought easily not by me you re not quite like the entps ve known and think they are one of the better types out there am good liar as am good actress but because have such strong conscience usually don take this road when first joined facebook made another account under different name never used it but just the act of making it was very empowering the reason was that found myself censoring much of am really borderline infp enfp do need time to recharge definitely but am not your stereotypical shy infp love going out and meeting new people am first on the dance floor and will stay it really depends on the individual do tend to like all the nfs and have an immediate rapport with most of them can see myself ever being with an istj or estp or an entj am infp love hippie looking clothes or jeans and leather jacket for casual red is my favourite colour to go out to restaurant would dress up quite lot classy would say with touch someone click with and who has similar values to me someone trustworthy who makes me feel like am the only girl in the room not just by their words but by their actions someone authentic and beautiful yes your friend definitely looks introverted for some reason thought number 2 was the entj well it sounds as though you are definitely an introvert am too but sometimes test as enfp because it m crap at this maybe in real life might be better well he doesn look intj but it is an intj posting it in and seeings they are not supposed to have friends ll go with intj he does look wait you re no 5 and no 1 is your brother well picked the hot brothers anyway you look more enfj definitely charisma and spark shining through would never pick your brother as intp from the yes think maybe intp his eyes do definitely have depth though no 4 think is infj or intp he looks less outgoing and thoughtful 3 of my 5 children are intps there is no way in the world my daughter would ever be labelled aspergers although she can probably be slightly insensitive once in while my oldest son scores quite don know but no 1 and n0 5 are hot lol quite good actually not as good as dating another nf though no don think people who are well off financially are poor in spirit but there are sector of males who seem to think if they are rich that guarantees them success in the dating world am happy don know which women you are talking about but money would not be factor for me in fact hate males who seem to think they can buy me my soul is not for sale if had to list one of the am infp but sometimes test as enfp d rather date the psychiatrist because psychiatry is more interesting it is something am interested in and even given that he has much the same personality am most definitely not gullible usually find my intuitions to be correct about people however do get myself into situations that others steer clear of because am kind and also like to sts and xntjs hi and thanks for the welcome love them agree almost completely what wrong with bit of sensitivity though hehe actually sps seem to like me much more than like them my last boyfriend was esfp and have had really hard time getting rid of him and thought they were supposed to move on easily would actually am quite good with strangers will talk to anyone and am usually the life of the party if actually choose to go to the party as said am not strong introvert but still find understandable homicide well don know enough entjs to pass judgement really there are people from all personality types who can easily rub us up the wrong way think it is more persons character sometimes then possibly infps have to admit have only known couple of entjs but thought both of them were arseholes enfj eyes the mixture between teddy bear and pure sexiness true of all the male enfjs have known have found them to be more stubborn then arrogant and trying to persuade them of your rightness on pure emotional reasoning doesn always cut it do love their honesty though actually have two adult children who are intps and also had really close friend who was an intp there is something think to the old adage that the eyes are the windows of the soul and yes swear that sometimes can pick an infj just by looking at their eyes there is something almost am an infp and scored 7 on that test but my intj ex husband would be a 30 or more and one of my intp sons actually scored 30 my enfp son on the other hand scored 13 am an infp enneagram type 2 and tend to find most infjs interesting in my opinion your only problem is that you are going for the wrong types of girls why not go for an infp who shares your values there must be plenty of attractive infp women out there not every haha too funny am infp and have been known to fall into either category mind you occasionally test as enfp am not strongly introverted am the best little slave unless you mess with my ve learnt to set boundaries with toxic people as have matured generally get gut instinct very early with people who are of the toxic variety but in the past was too kind to be able to shut especially love the song lithium have 5 absolutely gorgeous kids they are totally amazing have only ever

think it will help have troubles finishing those just end up thinking it useless since i know which function is in question and might as well rate the functions in have thought that shadow refers to the opposite of the function order like entj te ni and isfp fi se anyway guess my reply doesn reveal my shadow function it is not secret enough i no longer secret but being remarkable respected and loved head of the family when m old how people treat you when you re old shows how you have treated them how you have lived your life and grehoy don think could be estp se dominant and ti does not sound like me but entj could imagine was more stereotypically extroverted as child than m now maybe that my true thanks lot for your help need to research this entj possibility bit before can tell more may have had some prejudices about that type due to some descriptions could i trying to solve my mbti type in what my personality type forum and was suggested ixtj how to recognize which one istj or intj don recognize myself from the function descriptions thanks hare enjoyed your analyze well reasoned and it great to get feedback have troubles to see myself far enough and be reliably objective was wondering what was wrong with my siriusly anyone i need some serious help just cannot see the forest for the trees 2 you are with group of people in car heading to different town to see your favourite band artist musician 5w6 just based on what see above head types are obviously the most curious 5s need to specialize 6s need to question and 7s need to explore to me they seem equally curious thanks well thought never realized other image types share this need to stand out even though the reasons differ slightly and yeah teenagers often feel that way and there are many young adults no one has really suggested why other types than 4s also like and want to be somehow special and different even if it meant odd that what m interested not 4s need to be unique any it been impossible not to notice many people here perc value being special unique different one of the rare types etc what of this if any is type 4 this confuses me because also users that to me it seems more like wish and preferation to ignore sp issues despite the enneagram type sps naturally focus on sp issues and even when unhealthy their sp issues are still somehow ve understood that self preservation is about physical resources and condition and being hsp is about particularly low sensory threshold to continue with these definitions it seems they deal these theories and especially some of their interpretations are just so much more simple than reality that people get confused if they take it all too literally why couldn someone show both well you all belong to the positive triad and it is known that the general mood more positive or more negative is one of the biological temperament traits and thus at least partly inherited so for sure enneagram type is not inherited directly and your sample is extremely small to provide reliable conclusions anyway however certain personality related qualities such as temperament am reluctant to think that personality types would matter so much that they as such determined the relationship very far think any combination can be great one it truly depends on the either you have portrayed yourself on purpose like that or you truly are that but to me you seem very clearly what you think yourself too infp if you are enneagram 9 your 1 wing is strong my questions for every sx so here what kind of challenges related to your instinctual variants are you aware of and how does that awareness affect you what are you like at your worst this is great topic truly valuable since it about the essence of self awareness trying to see who you really are and differentiate it from your ego and the image you prefer to show to others think that people who constantly annoy others or people who constantly get annoyed or both have issues to deal with to become more healthy no type as such is related to being annoying also not things are only what you make them to be even when might associate mbti with tritype think there are numerous other possible combinations too personality is just too complex the way these theories associate with each other in drakeh would suggest you to focus on your strengths qualities that differentiate you from many others and things you truly enjoy mastering that way you at least won exhaust yourself doing disagree about 1s not belonging to the most power seeking group it is type that wants to correct influence master when justified reason is noticed knowing something is being done wrong those are considered to be separate theories so any combination is thought to be possible suggest great carefulness for typing yourself when unhealthy it is not an easy task even when you are avoiding real life social interaction hardly promotes social skills no matter what is being done instead to think this from another perspective internet has in way made me even more social think you are pretty consistent with expressing use of extroverted sensing that is obvious however instead of ti noticed more fi and to me the most likely type for you seems to be esfp by don think you are infj but te fi user what see most likely based on your post is intj there no need to let poor stereotypes confuse you you give the impression of enfp but also you must realize how incredibly unreliable it is to type someone based on this little information why not fill questionnaire at least have understood that stress related to disintegration does not need to be anything extreme think the amount of stress just correlates with how far you disintegrate differences between think the question you need to ask yourself is whether you are capable of understanding scientific phenomena to understand how the human body works you need to be able to understand physics some time ago had to type person know well and these two types were most obvious would differentiate those based on the way anger is dealt with and self is seen 9s are more passive 1s more ',\n",

people are well different but also scratches head but ask why to some people are different is not the end of conversation but eleven le beau coeur you two must be very comfortable with yourself ask the question because feel that am at fault for not being able to give more to others feel bad for having to remove that is so interesting when they say charging up charging sounds like getting energy to charge back in can see how this would work if extroverts recharge maybe introverts recover yes this is starting to work think new generalization must be discovered because although we s need our space it seems that s do too extroverts seem to be more socially balanced and thank you for the refreshingly simple affirmation of agreement it was nice soft start to my day am beginning to see trend growing out of the e responses am starting to notice an you may be right in fact you are right am not looking for an answer to take home so can move on am enjoying the conversation and found the question to be charged one am enjoying the hey that works and makes some sense thank you do feel this same high in smaller intimate settings with others it is just big groups that suck my energy not small ones okay very small no so sorry came off like that your posts are very well put together and make so much sense am just new and discovering what it is like to act like feel instead of what

of the contrasting pinks fuchsia so as to not fight with aquas full coverage but not ahh nuu art is not photography do not like realism in art leave that for the camera why bother with painting now that we have cameras because the camera cannot create feeling and mood and was replying to an artist who said still get some things wrong forgot to quote but now cannot find the artist lol just enjoy guess there is nothing right of wrong in art especially your art fixing anything you feel is wrong is only moving you closer to some stereotype and farther away from your artist soul technically you wow thank you for the response liked your help lot just do not think could do it have terrible problem in believing that am an infj for reason am no accident that means have okay you re saying there is way to turn it off omg this would be amazing could endure group projects without reducing my insides to rubble in order to maintain nice outside image not to ikr swear thought was the only one who felt this way in college said omg look what is happening to my heart decided then to begin repairing what the world had done to it began wow would think that is one way to run company not the only way you sound like you miss the energy of those meetings think you also have special dislike though for happy guy you feel fire person because they have cheerful attitude goodness you sound exactly like

these forums am getting the impression we infj are somehow tender and oh noo am designer do have terrible time finishing projects tho when design is all worked out in my head have little motivation to waste my time making it in real life m bored of it oops forgot to ask te extroverted thinking is what how can you think outside of yourself omg so funny yes we should group test and see what we make together lol really though find it funny and comforting to learn every bit can even missing personality trait tongue tested at keys2cognition where came up infj again but it rated my te extroverted thinking as unused did not know any of of our personality traits could be unused think this is so welcome new infj m new and have been having great time so many places to look for good threads don

from weekend everybody bingo you seem to understand it not about working the crowd or keeping the mood up this is like enter the room and all the moods slowly come into sync with mine for better or for our personality is who we are loneliness and depression are not in our personalities they are symptoms of life external to ourselves they may be circumstantial they could certainly be think want

there is the she oyster eating naked he wants out or he is having some serious physiological issues as in medication is needed he would tell you something if it could be fixed or play along if he was buying time think it peter didn i appreciate the culture behind art and the creative genius it takes to create that being said am not out visiting galleries or trying to intentionally find the meaning behind art which could sparky no not in colorado interesting thank you well put that estj don intentionally try to confuse people with their words have any of you ever experienced an estj that never comes to you he always wants me to come to him for that makes lot of sense the way you say it that it is not necessarily affection or condensing but that you have reached level of comfort and the saga continues guess lol sometimes m value everyone feedback thank you if you have any pilot it would be valued as well find it intelligent and creative that he is trying to find ways to tell me that he does care is this typical for an estj m mean sometimes the things he does are so subtle but outside of his thank you my only concern with this and again could be easily over analyzing this is that know from my reading up on estj is that they can regard you as child if they don perceive you to be there was no attitude in the voice and no inflection so am having friendly phone conversation with an estj who completely adore today the conversation was normal basic simple and out of nowhere he said what was that hun know this seems only 6hrs more to go here what kind of jobs do you esfj have it doesn sound right the only time would hide things like that would be from people that don like or care about or if they were being exceptionally nosy then would maybe even deliberately would love to

fluff anything words are justs tool used only when necessary wish didn have to speak yep yep yep shit this is getting out of my comfort zone but know he won mbti ants psychology animals appearance m sorry m rather new around here see did not reply correctly to each individual hopefully you will still get the response you said you don like to play with emotions do you toy with others to feed your ego m wondering if m some sort of toy he came back he said one step at time he showed me lots of value and caring so thought was good to ask him to get together or at least what he thought about getting together he didn emma m sorry to ask your opinion again risked it the first time asking him if he wanted to get together he ignored my request or at least he never answered which is just not normal for him he ok know your right to an extent about that but feel like don have the courage to call him what if everything is just in my head maybe should just move on if he cared for me like butterflies in my stomach have to have feelings before in my experience they only deepen after but think that is mostly due to the chemicals in our brains that get released after and during sex

school was about 13 14 at the time hadn made any good friends really except few acquaintances at this point was completely ignorant about sales is tough one but anything will become easier with practice when engage with clients have more of an advisory role if their circumstances don require it wouldn recommend anything doesn sound like you have given up rather you just have moved on this isn failure it does sound like your mum is overreacting but this is what parents are good at because they worry so be strong you clearly want to get out of this situation so you will have struggled with the same thing for different reasons and regarding mekristy advice exercise and vits helped me holgrave exactly my thoughts because guess its something do in my first year at uni was nuts all did was drink once the hangovers finally caught up with me calmed down especially as had to focus on work lot more the above posters are right you kind of enlightened me m sure there are more people out there that may not have realised yet just out of interest do you only use perc when you re feeling bit off key ecto endo m tall and slim was bit of chubber when was kid m mix because eat as much as want without seeming to gain weight but my body shape is little off and wouldn say strangely enough my other side is also istj never really thought about this before but the test result is definitely based upon my mood if m doing well and just getting on with life then food family and films for me don like all the present bullshit mainly because have no idea what to buy people it was great as kid but now feel like the stuff buy for people is as an infj it kind of ironic for us to unconditionally offer comfort to others as most of the time we also need it ourselves your selflessness is the whole reason come here would get simple 2 4 channel audio interface wouldn bother spending above 100 on 1 of these you can get them much cheaper audio create decent entry level gear but there are other well started on piano which don actually play any more played piano for about 6 7 years but ended up stopping because got sick of the whole grade thing as mentioned it caused me to loose hey lonewolf it sounds like you have trapped yourself and m sorry for you because know how things can spiral out of control leaving you disorientated and unsure on your next move ll think ll have to admit to being one of the people that will be deterred by popular music on the whole though won deny tune if its catchy what have you got to lose try not to think negatively because at the end of the day its better knowing than not knowing when was in 6th form college was seeing this girl for few months she was really nice and seemed quite into me she got bit too clingy like if we were out she would literally hold onto me friends always cheer me up only the close ones mind they are my go to option if m feeling bit down music has been with me for as long as remember started learning my first instrument when was quite young 7 8ish was classically trained but moved away from this by the time got to suppose we all go through different challenges in our lives which cause us to have different reactions remember being happy ignorant child with what felt like no problems this changed as i ve always been specialist but don one is better than the other you hit the nail on the head when you talked about leaders managers etc you don necessarily need to be generalist to scrapped my comment in the pursuit of happiness go get him my list is obviously different to yours but have the same explosive action you are talking about it takes lot to get me angry but when am have no control over my actions its like watching know what you mean as ve had similar experiences when was younger and we had family to stay my mum would always put all the cousins in my room did have big room so do see it as fair to as the other 2 mentioned it sounds like he is quite into you out of interest what exactly are you waiting for him to make the move 22 used to be book worm when was younger 8 14 15 years old all would do is read now just can be bothered and m not really sure why used to be nervous about reading aloud but today solved problem at work that have been working on for long time just goes to show that perseverance and patience pay off in the end cool idea for thread btw there is definitely definitely helped me to explain the no m not gay but do care scenario 50 man on side note could only think of about 3 words for each grey and happy lol was 2 when started speaking which m told is late that probably why awesome advice was exactly the same when was about 14 up til left uni 21 can say ve truly found my motivation again but at the same time m quite content with my life on side note none of this halo 4 yes that right m game geek m not 100 sure on this one but think my soon to be step mother is an infj if not then all can say is that she is very introverted can say we ve really butted heads because she have yet to have physical confrontation in my adult life obviously ve had arguments but not physical fights had few when was younger at school though when was in middle school age think have this issue now the last few relationships ve had as mentioned above ve held back so as not to appear too involved too early because it can put people off unfortunately this has aizar first post hit the nail on the head for me before knew anything about personality types or whatever used to do the exact thing but without realising now m still fairly new to this you re probably right on the faith front tend to hold back for long time but this has cost me the girl sometimes unfortunately you can always tell if it will work out and if you are holding think all of you above highlighted the fact that when you get out of your comfort zone you realise its not as bad as you think before got past this point felt like had to fit in now unfortunate about the lack of response but can relate to this which is why posted remember when left uni started working in pub my manager used to push me to sell the most disgusting the long walks you take etc will always be good for stress relieving and that doesn necessarily mean you re following your own pattern of conflict avoidance getting fresh air to clear your head you got unlucky mate never thought would get into sales and least never thought would be good at it turns out was wrong but don have to use manipulation to sell by saying you were no worries man hopefully you have some inspiration to stay on track and yes remember all too well the struggle had trying to learn my mates stuff sadly can play it any more as its not astral very good choice of words you ve definitely outdone any attempt could have made to say the same thing in answer to your question the way see it is that people will always need to ',\n",

entps ve run into my enfp acquaintances make me die inside no logic genuinely think that down to your particular intj if m honest so many factors determine how would respond to someone telling me they liked me directly other than being an intj some hi infjs m an intj lady with puzzling situation with an is nfj male colleague and would appreciate any insights started working in our office four months ago and quickly grew quite couldn be bothered reading how everyone else responded but think that lovely and lovely to send in letter rather than mail too someone else said they prefer letters to have some can speak for all intj women obvs but have consistently liked entp men the ones was able to type anyway it never worked out though so do wonder if it a case of never the p shall injustice towards myself or others especially if those others are weaker decided to post reply before seeing what everyone else wrote goes back and looks after years of puzzling over this problem and then being fortunate enough to have close circle of 5 6 enfj friends who can observe being sociable up close think it a combination of stuff dies laughing haha was well aware it was no brainer but that why the thing puzzled me how does he not realise how feel given all that happened and why it inappropriate for him to have stayed think what you say is completely within the bounds of possibility but as you say he isn taking ownership of the situation so there just no way for me to be sure it seems like could just hello since promised an update and since talking into the void evidently clears my mind little to cut long story short we went on the non date and it was literally everything you i ve never been told that directly by anyone but now that you say it realise it certainly been implied by previous love interests the thing is it completely confuses me why the would before learning about mbti found it nigh on impossible to deal with especially in romantic relationships it would take someone either with less strong or who was very understanding to deal thank you your responses are all really thoughtful and sensible and some bits really resonate the non date is tomorrow evening provided it doesn get rained off it has got even more m enjoying this tale hugely please keep us posted and yes kept typing gravypour then gravyapour until realised it was two separate words thegrayvapour you sound like good egg m sorry you re getting screwed around have done exactly what your girl seems to be doing so m just going to relay what think might have happened it less about changing my behaviour to get him to like me know he likes me and more changing it to encourage bit of distance without seeming like bitch think not hanging out with him yeah this you can know what you want but actually catching it is subtle art that eludes us or me anyway healthy mature entp or very understanding isfj also another intj hello isfjs have problem and could do with some advice at any rate it ll probably help my broken heart to talk about it anyway started new job in april and have got to know someone on one of my best friends is an infp and often go running to him whenever have some kind of emotional quandary would say not only does it reflect level of trust on his part but also an it really depends on who m losing my temper with will lose my temper at bosses on near weekly basis and never apologise for it namely because they re incompetent and someone needs to tell it is very hard to take this seriously with your avatar which like very much ve had thoughts along the lines of this question for many years before knew what mbti was felt very aware of stigma against rational considered women maybe against rational considered has anyone read this book it flawed but one of the few occasions ve seen introversion and its advantages mentioned and praised in popular culture here a video of the author speaking at dated an intp for two years very happily so yes he was pretty handsome which helped in terms of not taking you seriously in his particular instance he was extremely bright but continual again that really depends on the both of you might put up with your changing thought processes as long as you respected my need for you to eventually agree with final decision it be suspect he has got it bad poor boy like entps very much though my romantic relationships with them have always fizzled out very quickly some intjs have clownish whimsical side to them which is probably as close as we get to had to google what toastmasters club was that looks awesome really nerdy think work is pretty standard way for us to meet new chums too post school university if it helps at all since lilysocks ok think see what you re saying thanks guess in that particular instance it depends slightly if your occupation can be done in slightly rote way if you so choose as m have different best friends for different situations and ve met them all through school or university my childhood best friend is an ixfj that came about through shared acerbic wit and feel like that potentially useful advice but can quite envisage your meaning in practical terms can you give me an example yes though feel you have biased sample here yes but then just watched no strings attached so m not sure if my views are coming from healthy grounding in reality an autumn walk immediately followed by good pub fleetwood mac learning fleetwood mac on the piano volunteering with local homeless group actually this is slightly misleading it as cereszal says that sounds to me like she just become too attached to your messages and probably realises it is worried by it distanced myself too when felt like was getting too ah basically had exactly the same experience as you but from the perspective of the intj girl you can read about that rather unhappy relationship here if understood your post correctly yes am openly suggesting that phoebes83 date rapes her man into healthy relationship in an ideal world it true that you shouldn need to make someone drunk to bring out their true assume you re less interested in answers from the ladies my dad is an intj however and married to an exxj so ll try and answer from his perspective would say the following though some of seconded but then do this to people completely oblivious to the possibility of relationship even when have some idea of their interest and like them as friend and often wake up to it yep d agree with that actually have it written down in kind of mental notebook to be less fixated on being correct and more to just let people talk surprisingly it probably made me m surprised you ve come across no one like minded among at least your professors again maybe was fortunate but one of my great consolations through the horror that was school was having very helpful delineation thank you inspired by this thread decided to ask this question what does healthy intj look like what do they need to go through to get to better state apologies if the question already been the number of negative responses ve seen on here makes me feel little sad m curious to know how many of you saying no to the

              " ' started off shy and loner didn like to talk and was far from extroverted eventually got sick of being loner and tried to fix myself was really image conscious at first until it takes me while to understand someone deeply enough to love them once do give up my entp selfishness and put them first for most things also over analyze everything read way to deeply after managed to force myself to sit down long enough to write one managed it pretty lame after number 8 though breakfast or whatever good meal ll be eating that day what ll be doing with my friends that day or the time ll

like how close is the bond what ve never met two in person but they sound like they be hard to please m lazy don do favor unless it my idea which wouldn please 2 don like the unhealthy 3 know she i ve gotten enfj infp intp entp enfp and recently someone thought was an esfj which is strange because m not sensor at all kittens easy to break but once it broken no one wants to go through intj enfj enfp my closest friends are intj they enjoy the fact that even though m feeler m still rational when upset enjoy listening to them show me the logic behind how they think get along well with the entp know see past his manipulation do have the problem that he fickle and will leave you the second he amused by something else but he always comes back i prefer intuitives just because like to have abstract conversation senesor throw in to many details and it annoying don think their less intelligent just think their better at act like an extravert around people m fairly charastmatic and good with reading body language so use it to my advantage alot of people think am one know m an introvert because m 1 my cheeks there odd looking on my face 2 how look 12 since all my features are tiny except my eyes and forehead 3 how shake whenever get freaked out 4 how terrified am of talking to quiet friendly nice happy sounds pretty good to me though some people think m to quiet at night m always more likely to confront someone or have deep conversation my brain always works better and everything flows better can be completely different person when writing to ve always been an environmentalist but when global warming started to connect to people got really into it always do the click and ads appear so money can earned to be donated to protecting it m 3w2 but 9w1 also score pretty high english is my first language but m working towards becoming fluent in french yeah make awkward eye contact lot tend just to stare at whatever is making noise so get lot of weird looks ve made few of my friends take the test but only 2 of my friends know my username one is friend discovered this site with and the other is the person that trust with everything all my my voice is really high pitched and soft can speak loud normally love sneezing just the sensation and have that little tickle goes away feels so good cannot stand istj or isfj the istj is to structered and opposite from me and find i sfj to dramatic and unwilling to not be the victim the one know isn very healthy but in general my eyes 17124 have naturally fast metabolism also whenever get upest run and lose my appetite don do anything to stay thin just got lucky was an extp when was younger became introverted after bullying and fairly traumatic incident always test as an infp or intp and both of my functions are well developed ventured in there once it never happened again when you hug someone thinking it your friend and it not when you texting and someone looks at you and says oh thought you were loner when you make eye contact by accident look away for certain types you can tell by facial expressions ve noticed infp tend to look like there lost in thier fantasy world and have innocent looks intj tend to always look serious can see isolate myself whenever someone hurts me become even quieter and start to avoid even those m close to don mean to but when someone breaks my trust or lies can stand being around them still havn felt the massive earthquake the only thing can be kind of paranoid about is that my friends arn really my friends and everyone hates me in secret ve always been one of the top students but don think m that intellient don know my iq but m in all enhanced classes right now think drive is big factor in grades can sleep anywhere for 8 11 hours m also teenager though and most of us can sleep days away completely lost as to what happening with me right now m really optimistic like to block out the bad since it normally goes good also like to believe that you create what you want so if believe can do something and that it will go well it m somewhat healthy m an optimist and generally don get in unhappy moods the one problem have is m constantly fighting being introverted in highschool everyone is extraverted and have the same tri type as you but related most to 9w1 so selected that as my type m at point where neither love nor hate myself have things really wish could change or improve on but know can i ve accepted them but havn come to point where ve embraced don really care about grammar as long as it isn terrible people make typos and not everyone has firefox to fix them though chatspeak really gets on my nerves write really fast and sloppy read and think faster than my hand moves had to go to physiotherapy for my hands when was little it was so horrid also

view on well do actually believe this take some responsibility my life needs improving my self belief and confidence etc if had worked harder up until now to improve those things maybe my friend have had issues with feeling suspicious about people true intentions in the past mainly because when was younger was used alot and taken for ride and probably do suffer from low self exactly its not about thinking he owes me something he owes me friendship and to be nice no its not that at all it the obvious avoiding behavour another example is his food would go off m asking for people advice perspective really on this have friend who go out with alot at weekends drinking the weekend just gone he was djing at club for night he asked me to come think you re onto something with the high standards perfectionist thing he does appear that way the first day he moved in he painted the whole room white again even though it was fine kinda so basically have 2 bedroomed apartment and rent out the spare room ve had lodgers for the past few years moved someone new in about 4 5 months ago made an effort in the few month thanks man yeh it would be interesting to talk to another infj alike too m not skype but im on facebook ill send you over pm thanks that gave me some great insight and clarity think ive figured the main cause to most of my problems and its confidence m paralyzed and gripped by uncertainty fear because lack confidence in myself figured it kinda looks like the weight of stone is different here on earth than on our moon thanks for your reply m glad to hear from someone who been through the same thing feel exactly the same about big things atleast know have to focus on that and have focus without my can relate to the artwork thing started not enjoying music so much when started getting gigs where had to find and play music that others enjoyed not so much that liked ve tried ill try to explain what goes through my head when try to focus on one thing say decide right now for the next 3 months to just focus on what enjoy what like doing which is making music was wondering if anyone else has been through this and can maybe give me some perspective insight on how to get out of it right now feel stuck confused overwhelmed know that don want so came across dating article the other day was reading the comment section and some guy was talking about fe and fi from what take from his comments and may be taking this in negative the feeling in my head is definitely something to do with the warts had the same feeling on citalopram years ago ve heard about this bi polar does run in my family my dad suffers from hey guys started talking st johns warts last week to try and life my mood just little as have just started new job 6 days in and feel worse my head feels like it throbbing like its for the single mums 241210 my sincere apologies pritty much agree with everything you ve said too many young women who are not fit or ready for children having kids don even know who they are themselves in this world know was brought up you have some valid points agree different women are attracted to different things have different values etc maybe m just fighting being myself right now and its making things worse feels like think the word you looking for is balance agree and yes would agree have maybe swung too far over to the left from bad experiences im aware and am working on it have hard time well no not technically every human is fundamentally trying to always feel better than they do at any current moment infjs get pleasure from helping others and seeing others happier you are look all this really depends on the context sure m polite and nice to people ill offer if people want anything from the shop for example who don really know if stranger is in trouble guess you could call it healthy nice guy and unhealthy nice guy the unhealthy nice guy is perceived as nice on the exterior but is riddled with insecurities unhealthy way of dealing with we ve obviously had different experiences throughout life use to be that guy and got walked over all m saying is being perceived as nice guy opens you up for alot of exploitation its ob thanks do make the first contact but the problem is don match with anyone fancy mean they re mostly women with kids or women don find attractive have recently grew my what is it with me and attracting mostly single mums on dating sites any other people have trouble with this it like im giving off this easily malleable nice guy vibe that carn stand i from warrington too for what purpose do you want to study psychology help others satisfy an interest out of the 2 what would you say you spent most of the day thinking about for years chased dream dream to make music that connected with others that lifted people up through rouge times like it did for me music was something that got me through hard times in eric prydz and deadmau5',\n",
              " ' first of all just want to say thank you to all the amazing replies in this post really feel like my questions were understood and appreciate the insights offered and am grateful you all took thanks dabbling for your thoughtful response can understand that and like to think in an established relationship those things are likely to be easier once you ve set the tone for the hi all apologize if m not doing this right m actually back after long absence and ve had this on my mind for while so thought would start discussion m an intj female and do you believe in destiny absolutely not feel it a convenient way for people to take back seat in their own life and with the short time have want to make the most of it work my hardest popinjay okay it might be little worrisome that lot of what you ve described about shadow fe feel does apply there could be some possible issues concerning some past childhood events of m an intj and was previously in the art field and still love being creative but couldn stand the disorganized completely subjective field that requires heavy socialization to get known could you enlighten me about what you mean concerning fe m not really sure what that is also think that could be good to be direct about what want and to try more casual relationship my last relationship wasn particularly burdensome overall did try to please him and thus went out and did things with him and for him that wouldn have done otherwise but imagine that my take on these 1 if romantic relationship ends badly would it be easy for you cut all ties and never talk to your ex again used to buy into the whole no we can still be friends am native fluent in french and decent in spanish though haven really used it since school love languages though and have been teaching myself couple here and there bit odd sounding lately feel the intjs can say love you one is absolutely me why are emotions so annoying would like to ask not quite for advice but think rather more for perspective hope this is okay to post m little hesitant about sharing but in place like this it feels safe and detached are we allowed to vent here feel like this topic has most likely been talked about or not but lately m so tired of emotional people don know what it is feel like was more aww thank you so much ahmenrah m glad you like it aww thank you and if you do let me know and ll read it thank you so much cookiemonster m glad you can see an improvement m trying each time work to make it as good as can which is hopefully better than the time before thanks for the yea that a good way to look at it 3 worldink has some good points don think any of the people fully trust have morals that deviate much from mine because couldn really see eye to eye agree with or even like someone who was oh kathryne that is exactly how feel and view everything you have described it perfectly it that mask and do feel that we are adaptable can put on that bubbly mask when the situation thanks for the clarification was just curious when people around the forum say they know types in real life what they meant of course some may use it differently than others but it seems like out of curiosity isitso and anyone else who replied here actually when you share opinions about intjs you know or when you talk about confirmed or not confirmed are you talking about people who trying not to fall asleep don know why m so tired right now wish you the best of luck heather and m by far no expert in men or relationships trying to learn what can perhaps it is tied to some sort of unconscious fear it the only idea can have felt this in previous crushes and relationships to the point where was so infatuated with guy thought about him 24 7 missed him when he was away couldn stop talking about him it only recently learned about all these types and feel bit strange about being an intj know that the comments in this thread are generalized or perhaps more likely the opposite focused on for me m not sure if can explain it right but it not an issue of trust it more an issue of seeing eye to eye there are limited number of people do trust and do as many people in thanks indigo thanks for the comment glad you like it aye drew it all trying to improve it every week thanks for the feedback too realize they all seem interested in her but trust me it not all agree with this math isn always easy but once figure it out get excited and solving problems can get really fun thanks for the welcomes all miss you too have you been well we shall catch up soon 3 haha yes he just told me about it day or two ago it great to see you here hugs miss you too how have you been shall definitely send you buzz on aim the webcomic is work in progress m the eldest with two brothers 2 and 4 years younger very male dominated household completely focused on science even my mother a microbiologist somehow came out of that as an artist sketching some new characters of mine m brand new here too not entirely used to this classification myself but it nice to meet you look forward to seeing you around will see what can find thank you have not am exploring the forum at the moment where would find those well then the question becomes how do you define your temperament from what types perhaps description of myself is in order feel like can get by in social situations without standing my favorite subject was biology and my most hated sports probably would have pursued biology if hadn had trouble when switched schools now m in art but considering going back to biology maybe m overthinking everything too much well shall leave it at that then thank you very much for your help hmm see well d say gain energy from contact that value lose energy from contact that don so small talk or chatting or daily interactions from people that am not close to for estj well the fact that don get along with most people and even though can easily talk if want to in social situations small talk that is don really get to know many have very small so that would definitely make me an extrovert from the individual definition of the concept don think if fits but then don really understand the relationships between the different parts most efficient definitely hmm then that makes it tricky ve been looking at them individually so haven sat down and looked through all of them and something just occurred to me perhaps my confusion stems from being immersed in an intj family i have looked at estp which is too competitive and just overall not really matching me looked at istp but don think m as territorial and inflexible have strong convictions but those are follow rules and guidelines only so long as believe they are correct and the best path to follow would never follow rule for the sake of merely following it considered istj but that description seems too cold and dedicated to duty to suit me do follow rules and guidelines but m not that strict about anything really took another one and here didn save the results so took it again and got yet another estj cognitive processlevel of development preference skill and frequency of use extraverted sensing se love frank and honest crit most of all so do not be afraid about that if could not accept that how would improve think an artist who cannot accept and follow crit won be able to become ',\n",

post 97 in post 100 azrael point 1 atheism is belief that there is no god if atheist claim to not know exactly how the universe came to be they are being dishonest if you really do not know or have belief personally do not really believe in human spirits existing in our universe because there is no observable evidence to support them am not saying they do not exist just do not see any reason kestrel bioghost comparing god to dragons and pink unicorns is bit dishonest there is not direct and definite evidence in judeo christian god but there is evidence in creative presence your point is valid perhaps should say the god believe in also the actions you are referring to were done by irrational an imperfect people the same could be said for anything never claimed that only god is good just that goodness is the character of god and for direct response to your silly question why have similar words at all we could simplify everything am not saying person cannot be good without believing in god some of the best people know and some of the people admire most are atheists am saying there is no finite goodness morality enfp love to chitchat with anyone and everyone about anything and everything this is really not critique as much as it is an observation am usually doing something else while listening to music walking hiking driving working etc rarely listen to music with lyrics because most people do not have properly tuned vocal cords if you are believer in god you believe god is good goodness is god character if you are an atheist good is an abstract term that has no true definition try to simplify as much as possible but it really depends on the audience strangers get no answer associates get short answers close friends get answers to questions they did not ask and my spatial that sounds about right most people thought my istj friend he now has serious girlfriend was homosexual for the longest time am not sure why though he never had girlfriend but he also never had boyfriend i eat oats with cocoa nibs and honey with regularity for regularity but not daily need an option for has distracted me from work quite bit have rage issues but am getting

don watch too much television but breaking bad is the greatest piece of motion picture ve ever seen even among movies and v series there were some parts didn like but overall it was hello ve recently come across this girl esfp girl whom have suspicion that she likes me d like to know if any esfps out there can make judgement call based off of the following info because lot of them tend to think that they are somehow owed credit for the works of some historically influential intjs like newton for example they think that just because they shared the same as of late ve been reassessing whether am thinker or feeler the main reason for this is because most of the time am relatively passive even when am annoyed or irritated well she said she didn have the time to study yet was out drinking with some friends the night before test not that she as going to pass but guess that would just fall under poor time sorry but could you put the hedging bets meaning into an example for her situation doesn necessarily have to be true just want to understand what you mean by this and ve done this understand but still if not an at least get c so you can receive credit but it is what it is maybe she just had lot in her life going on m sure she did but think deliberately yep which is why couldn believe the results still dont see her as an intj her character is somewhat compatible but she doesn seem to share that sharp distaste for mediocrity we were what exactly do you mean by hedging the bets think know what you mean but m not 100 sure yes she has withdrawn little but then again we text lot during her job hours so she what your reaction to someone whom you ve known for bit and get along with good and know he likes you who asks you question like what asked her about why she isn looking for minor correction she an intj got her to take the test if you believe she is toying with me what could be possible reason for preserving relationship the very first mbti test took gave two results primary personality type and secondary personality type my primary type was intj and my second as infj ve never been able to find the test just behave and don post overly offensive material like that guy snapple did perhaps shouldn have generalized but the intjs ve seen do they don seem to be able to adapt or blend in with different social environments maybe its because they aren mature enough or well she had to work lot she texted me that she had worked 11 hours while still at work so we still haven gotten together she has two upcoming days off and mentioned to her that bike funny how life is turns out you were right she actually is an intj got her to take the test was stunned to say the least by the way from at movie is that gif know it from japanese anime film about demons or spirits of nature but can remember the point of this thread is too subjective the point of this thread was to try and get inside her head she did ill pm you then how did she guess that liked her what makes you think haven been aggressive just curious thought thank you see have friends and acquaintances that carry that mindset and don get me wrong they get lots of sex but that all they get m not interested in just sex ve been around whores and sluts is it possible that you ve surrounded yourself with whores and sluts for such long time that you ve come to the conclusion that all women are like this m not arguing against the alpha male tell me do you prefer meaningful relationship or cheap sex with rotation of women that you are friends with with the exception of the occasional girl from the other side of town want what intellectual pursuits are you referring to no didn think you were joking ve met your type before pussy how so who is they are you generalizing women again or are you referring to certain personality type woah had no idea you guys were chatting it up like is in here okay hornet then how could or would have made myself more attractive to her according to you also don think of her as being number so and so out of three billion understand what you mean but she is entirely unique unto herself and m not looking for just any woman if that were the like said won be keeping my hopes up nor is my intention now to somehow conquer her by trying to be her best friend or something know how to put emotions behind me want to stay in definitely won give up hope even though don have my hopes up and will be neutral to whatever decision she may make in the future whether she wants to stay friends or explore different want to let everyone know that finally decided to let her know how feel pretty much just texted her and told her that liked her and that wanted to know how she felt about me and that i see asked because you give good advice and like how you advice and some of your explanations seem to fit say that not because m in some sort of self denial due to the possibility that thanks by the way can help but ask how do you know her so well aside from being an infp the affirmative ness of your answers catches my attention for some reason my intuition tells me disregard this post hadn seen your previous one thanks really appreciate your advice though just one question do you think if go about 3 weeks without texting our main way of communication and decide to text her week prior to the thank you larac that was very informative and calmed my anxieties bit so far haven confessed to her to confess to her my feelings would mean that ve given up on her and have decided to know what the op feels like enjoy the gifts that come with being an intj but there are times when it feels like curse can compare it to having superpowers much like superhero has you spend 24 hours day weighing and evaluating the chances that peer of which you like might like you back right so what is it that makes you think she doesnt want relationship with me mean what details make you sway more towards thinking that she isnt interested as opposed to taking neutral one last thing in the unlikely event that she does set something up should mention my feelings for her then and there or should try to get to know her bit better and facilitate another thanks for your kind words will give her approximately few more days wont text her until then if she doesnt bring up the bike ride think it is best if text her about it because she thanks this sucks on so many levels but guess it is something that needs to be done highly appreciate everyone help see so when do tell her what do do afterwards do still stay her friend or is it best to just move on and forget her assuming she doesnt like me wait nevermind my post you already did thank you for the words of encouragement btw could you have look at what galaxies believes about her not because want you to convenience her that she likes me or something in an attempt to the thing is that didnt say anything mean or hurt her feelings im 100 sure of it we have never talked about any truly political

was an obvious place for you to meet at that activity then don think it unreasonable for her to expect you to meet there also she could just have left her computer on and therefore we love you too it

you are his girlfriend doesn mean that you aren also his friend he probably just didn want to sound like he was criticising his friend this blog is the reason use tumblr can do it the thing that

anyting on my own it the difference between ne and ni also get far too worried that the other person of course would why would not don believe in an afterlife but m also not worried about dying wouldn want to be concious forever anyway think it more the fact that we don get to pay for you which we like doing mature infj shouldn have problem with this though think all of these are true of me

personalities it essentially captures that idea that infj are good at enabling potential in other people whatever that may be this isn mine but infj doodles is brilliant and seems relevant here wish had better advice for you but fear am no better at these things than you think you are on to something when you talk of displays of love being unwanted or intrusive don know you only need basic feelings but you need to prove it unfortunately people lie about these things so simply saying that you feel certain way isn enough to dispel people doubts if you say well certainly like to socialise more than that 2 3 times week would probably be more typical and more than that can be handled if necessary it is also the case that socialising with close haven mistyped as intp but the tests back when couldn see through all the questions used to type me as entp think the extraverted bit was wishful thinking at the time on my part and if he anything like me he probably worried about bothering you yes even if it would be obvious to anyone else in the world that he wouldn be d be to the point and say that you want him hmm think they won see this action as that much of big deal in itself but the fact that he likes to spend time with you in that kind of way is comfortable with your family etc is leading into it adds emphasis to it and makes it more obvious it also tends to make the person doing the telling feel better therefore try to avoid it unless am deliberately trying to draw 1 mbti does seem to be partially descriptive of human personality however it is not wholly descriptive and it would definitely be wrong to ascribe definite characteristics to particular type as someone who was taken to counselling as child and then not taken back as wouldn cooperate would echo xemilyx about treating them as an adult would also say that the essential problem actually an infj shirt isn a bad idea if an infj does happen to see it great and if anyone else asks well get to talk to them about something m interested in and they find something out yeah but opinion polls are close to 100 accurate people know who they support and have no reason to lie whereas mbti tests not so much have also tested as entp on mbti tests and still do sometimes the tests aren so great the connection with enfp is amazing love the way they love life and are interested in everything around them ne makes them interesting and the part means that they really care that would agree with this think your idealism can be reminiscent of children who haven yet seen anything bad in the world not that this is bad trait in fact would like to think that could find meaning in helping people to be happy and removing their suffering regardless of whether there is any point people seem to want to live and it seems to be worthwhile to help them to make why can you compare the suffering of animals to that of humans you might be right that that of exploited children is worse but that would depend on what was causing the animal to suffer hehe that website is great yes but generally don spend as much time with others as would like hmm this is interesting d be very interested to know how you guys do like to make arrangements for things would you prefer that just called you and asked you if you wanted to do something find it very difficult to talk about my feeling to girls who haven declared any interest in me or it not very obvious but love expressing them to people who know will want to hear about nope and to be honest struggle to see how anyone could think it was d be interested to know if anyone does have good reason for believing this all sorts of things lot of people say they don know and sometimes they come back couple hours later when they ve thought of something lot of people turn the question back on me and ask don i know it used to not do it because know it makes some people uncomfortable but ve found that as long as you smile and shrug it off if they don want to answer then most people don can you see me m right here in my chair um but anyway like to talk to people to find out what they are like and who they are unfortunately not many people like strangers randomly one of my best friends is an enfp and it does drive me crazy that so rarely get to see her although this is partly because we now live in different places for much of the year wouldn ever hmm my instinct would be to put this down as mother thing my mother enfj can get quite upset when don spend enough time with her still live at home just and she often communicates hmm think this is true however also think that lot of my self image is based on what other people think about me and how they react and interact with me hmm that is interesting provides an interesting lens through which to see similarities between introverts and extroverts got 46 ',\n",

my liking well said fellow intps do you think that there are dumb intps by that mean intellectually not emotionally or artistically my thoughts are this with so many points of data statistically someone laurie17 agree with you have never understood relationships that aren going to be serious have better things to do and maybe better people for me to meet am married intp female have so many curiosities about so many subjects the saddest thing though is that don like or relate to most of the humanity that created all of the neat things in the world yes do live in slc currently work in clinical laboratory also build furniture from salvage or reclaimed materials it different but fun this is good observation agree have been tested at various stages of my life am confirmed intp but as input comes in realize need to think and interact differently in order to well fuck other people say can tell by your stories that he loves and respects you hang in there we all grow in our own ways one day he will peak his head out would be computer which is actually bunch of inanimate objects guess because information would flow through me all day and could people watch la li lu le lo it still what think though even with new perspective the logic is still sound hmm well don think my family loved them they just couldn say no to hungry and lonely children from the trailer across the street it took away from our family 10 people in singlewide hmm well think that statistically speaking anything is possible that being said some people are more willing to analyze their experiences and decide to try to be or or overtime as hii intp here just out of curiosity of what do your best days consist we only have one letter apart so maybe they are similar think birth control should be forced on teenagers and those who cannot take care of the children they already have meaning people on welfare or in and out of prison my family took in what my mom well no did not explain that correctly want him to be in charge so he can tie me up or move me however he pleases really like that aspect letting him get all the pleasure he wants and since not really submissive at all rolleyes but am curious to see if would like it it turns me on in theory but would like to try out my hypothesis its not my usual style like true very useful information think you are probably right am always the one in charge though sometimes it is nice to just be the one following that is not very intp of me know priva well that makes sense he does need lot of lists from me we did we have been together for 8 years now people change tastes change especially for the curious we are really open people and he says he likes the idea do whatever he asks once get have no shame know am an intp female and really like to be submissive during sex my husband is not really the dominating type have used logic and asked him to create schematic greetings all am confirmed intp and have been since my first test as 14 years old gifted student setting again at 18 leadership course and most recently at 26 curiosity though do definitely know how you feel about sharing yourself with someone who won judge or freak out at your thoughts it so hard to find someone interesting and interested if that makes sense if it hear you the thoughts thing is hard great but hard take some zoloft for that it has made my life immeasurably better as to the intp partner have an intj husband and we get along can relate to this quite bit my husband is an int like me but needs verbal encouragement lot which am not great at ve noticed that we are starting to overlap in few areas that we to me this makes sense when an intp understands what someone needs from them as partner they will try to do that because its good logic love this person they need i will give them ok think some people are surprised by the evolution of an intp over time in relationship at first we can be formal stoic and overly critical because we are observing new people so we are sometimes d like to be j instead well we aren really bitches just brutally honest some people just don like my perception of the truth and that is ok with me don usually talk to people anyway like the way am it is challenging sometimes but have an intj husband that have an epic love affair with and two close nt friends enjoy being alone otherwise ignorance slackers but only in professional sense don really care what people do in their personal lives unless it affects me or my own absolutes because the universe is ever changing ask us question about something that would be intellectually stimulating had moment like this in high school and it was delicious mr intp was very hot and intelligent so spied on cannot speak for all intp women but like to do almost anything alone now alone or with my husband an intj like new stimuli and input so will try almost anything once or twice but don when m stoned get couch lock so badly enjoy the same stuff as when m sober but am much more relaxed find that it helps me deal with people other than my family and close friends it agree with everything you said actually m not suggesting that she should be protected that is m ok with 21 year old man dating 15 year old am remembering back to the data of my early explore the forensic anthropology center in knoxville aka the body farm be proficient with at least one weapon learn another language be my own boss live in another country convince my intj am really empathetic have experienced lot of hardship pain happiness sadness and triumph in my life these experiences are data

stereotypical portrait of an intj typed myself by breaking it down to the eight functions however i personally go for surgery since like working with my hands and it seems like physicians need to be more compassionate which is not my usual nature _ see your point just had different perspective on what pushing one belief entitled thought it was when one attempts to convert another it doesn feel like pushing to me if he don think he was really pushing his belief onto others not in this instance anyway also don have sufficient info to strongly support my stance on global warming do have an opinion but it is quite flexible to change on this topic don actually believe that man will destroy the world by the end of the century again am still pretty ignorant of the whole global warming controversy so currently do not have strong stand clarify do you believe in the current climate change at all or do you just believe that humans did not play significant role in climate change though agree that an actual science needs way see our current situation as one that is being artificially supported and one that can only be temporarily supported currently do not plan to have children first of all am not fully that is debatable and nowhere near is big exaggeration if our population has grown so much that we change the climate of the whole earth exterminate huge record number of species by one ender game and the da vinci code series and other dan brown books gregor the overlander it has pretty low reading level but love the story so much xd the selfish gene by richard war is petty and unnecessary way of solving conflict from one perspective it irrational and if intellects ran the world they would realize that war is not an efficient way to solve matters how much do you read not as much as d like when used to have free time d read about 300 600 pages per day now it limited to reading articles online but do have reading binges this doesn really work well in intj forums i don love animals but if had to have one it be cat exactly for that reason xd oh that link helps m unkempt beauty too sleep with blanky m 17 but can see myself with it at 25 petting blanky so soft haha the irony xd m definitely not girlie girl don think m hardcore tomboy but think do lean towards that side understand that to some atheism conveys hostility to religion but that is not its actual definition in fact atheism is lack of belief in religion so do not understand how is being an our basic purpose here is merely to reproduce to pass on our genes and die but don really feel like doing that goes to bother the nearest person only to find that there is nobody in the people can also hear things unobjectively if that a word so that can be bias but do understand that being people we probably don achieve it 100 know don that why won mind how is being atheist religious theist is religious person and adding the prefix means not religious person ve also wondered why think that it due to ignorance m actually don really care whichever gives me more solitary time ve done from 5 am to 1 pm school nights 4 am to 6 am or all nighters and 10 pm to 3 am i didn know liking horror movies was an intj thing d like to add that also like blood and gore and watching doing dissections and autopsies actually haven done the latter yet haha that exactly what do but usually when say like someone it more like admiration resepct don think ve ever liked someone romantically even if did d tell myself that on the speculations on the human brain evolution think that one of the more popular ones concern our need for bigger brains to make and use tools found another that like better competition don know about others but actually don really like those your face or your mom kind of jokes like puns irony and racist stereotype jokes though and use emoticons too usually think of the things need to do and outline my homework essays which ve procrastinated on so like others end up with me staring at the wall and using up the hot water surgeon currently because like blood guts and anomalies and it pays well this is interesting scored very strongly in and and ti as well which was why also identify pretty strongly with intp and pretty low for and are you being harassed ma am this provoking appears to cause you distress don see belligerence in skycloud responses skycloud is merely pointing out the fallacies in your posts if you objectively reread your own posts think that you ll realize that you re being thanks monkeyfritz and skycloud86 for posting my sentiments first so don need to no m trying to say that would not be surprised if every other kid did that or to be specific and quoting you it may be trait of ni whom would assume are roughly half the population hm but wonder if other types have imagined things upside down and if so how many of them forgot had done that until read this but it doesn seem like an inordinate thing to do would suppose usually dress tomboyish sweatshirts tshirts jeans but don mind wearing dresses now and then because they re convenient to wear no worrying about matching tops with bottoms but based on my experiences and observations this appears to be true consider myself relatively tomboyish dress in dark colors and simply m not interested in pursuing men and generally enjoy actually would choose intj if it were choice so m glad you think so happy originally thought it didn fit because procrastinate lot thanks for you insights especially on the p fantastic have tried that and ve found that can always find few things that are applicable me in one way or another in both types also think that that they re bit general and might monkey fritz completely agree but this is personal view don really mind what others think do though do have my opinions on it they should feel free to distribute their carryons oh think know what you re getting at what do you mean by low energy processes though and if like making schedules and plans and wish followed through with them but don because m spectrum yes those are the top types m indecisive about the description of intp from that site does mostly fit but there are some discrepancies for example would rather become master of actually was wondering if was unbalanced somehow don think fit with the disorders mentioned in the thread though about the other article took the quiz based on my personality thanks again do you have more interesting articles to recommend hmm want to be surgeon because it will further allow me to understand the complexities of the human body it also an leaves thank you so much for taking the time to post those links to me they gave me another perspective about the mtbi however the links to to threads on personalitycafe led me

              " ' to be honest don know if would truly be capable of doing what you want your mom to do don know if can truly let go of what feel need out of relationship for those truly out of the four nt types ve always gotten along with intps the best my best friend is an intp and know few others that ve always gotten along very well with out of the four nt types they for me this gets easier the more do it also kind of like to go back through the reasons why said no and remind myself that they re completely legitimate and important try to use those agree that this is individual for me but also think that it makes sense for their to be general connection between the idea of tradition and si users this doesn mean that every sj is going well for me what mean by tradition isn always the same as what other people mean don mean it in sense of ceremonies or doing things the way they ve always been done or doing to be honest as others have said really don think any of this has to deal with the exact type of sj we re talking about think it down to your personal experience think any one of for me personally this is pretty complex topic it hard for me to say what motivates me to do good things for others lot of it depends on my relationship with the person have have noticed that with those that m close to because open up more to them they do see me as deep person and understand my depth so definitely agree that the more we share things about definitely agree with the part about si that totally how feel and it something that can be very hard to get across or describe to non si types and that the exact reason why it i do hunk this all or nothing mentality is fairly typical in isfjs and think it directly related to our dominant si we have trouble adapting on the spot and we stay very committed to things think all in all you ve covered the topic very well think big part of the problem is how people define the terms deep and shallow shallow always carries lot of negative connotations and ve been high school math teacher for ten years anyone of any type can be great teacher and any one of any type can be bad teacher it just like anything else in life your type will can you give some specific examples of this you sound very flexible to me you must be very strong to work in daycare as mentioned in another thread know nothing about babies or well you can win em all especially on the internet definiteky view myself as cuddly light actually think m very cuddly but hide it and hold it back lot especially because m male usually get along with intps extremely think lot of it depends on other aspects of the friendship too it really depends if the other one cares about the friendship or not when you do contact the person if they agree to hang think this is really good point mentioned this sort of thing in another thread and an intj and an intp both mentioned how they are really appreciative of people who make the effort to keep up well think it really depends on if you think you should be bothered by whatever it is that bothering you in my previous post was referring to things that you deep down felt shouldn this has definitely happened with me though the details are different for me think what tough is that it so hard to make new deep friendships so much of this goes back to my own agree with falcon5 one of the biggest things that helps me is not reacting in the moment never let yourself respond to your immediate emotions as si doms things catch us off guard and first off ninetypesoflight gave awesome advice as far as the short notice thing sometimes you just have to say no and not care what she thinks isfjs have hard time saying no when we think my post 29 addresses this the best am fully aware this this isn about me and would never in my life expect my two friends to look after my emotions sending one card and two texts and as ve mentioned was more relieved than anything else it made me feel good to know that it meant something to her the thing is that ve never expected response especially not and can watch it because m not home m going for the sharks but have feeling your pens will win the cup that good to know usually do try to give logical advice when my friends ask for it try to come up with something and kick around some ideas guess just usually feel like it doesn go do understand that without the background explanation of the situation and explaining lot about myself which ve left out all of this sounds and in some ways is obsessive but think thank you for that this lines up perfectly with what ve been learning from the entp ve talked to one thing ve noticed about my estj friend is that he always helped me out with so many this is always something ve struggled with concerning types ve always felt like ve wanted to help them practically and logically but it seems like every time they have problem can it interesting these are the kinds of things that my inferior ne has always been super worried about however what ve learned lately is that can let my mind get carried away with these find her particularly fascinating because it took us while to figure out her type but think where her intp attributes come out the most is when she in her work environment even though that good to know my main thing is just understanding what the silence means m trusting in the idea that if was being annoying an intp would be likely to tell me instead of just being hiya intps haven posted much in this forum because for the most part ve gotten along very well with intps in my life though m an isfj myself my best friend is an intp and get along m totally the same way when laugh my teeth show but when smile normally especially in pictures never like to show my teeth it looks goofy to me when do it but definitely notice it hard for me to say because this situation is different than how it would be for me m guy and my dad would never stop me from dating someone of course m also 32 so my opinion may wish had read this before seeing your posts about my sj rant while back it explains whole lot more about everything think this is huge part of all of this when m stressed become much more irrational and emotional and can think clearly it hard for me to stay calm and make good decisions so if just ran across this video and found it quite fascinating',\n",

pseudonymity my 2 cents prefer befriending women for the very reason you mentioned have more female friends than have male friends and the ease at connecting with them is something else it also works in the reverse in my case if find that someone initially clicked with kept attacking things have very strong stance on ve ended friendships without second thought it jumped in to highlight the important part nothing hits home harder than realizing oh my god he she really does care voting limited life as well existence for the sake of existing isn living what defines something is its end life without death isn life kinda controversial right and wrong are matter of perspective yet there is at least bit of truth in every statement at least that my view touché moogles too true every word kinda apt that you chose moogle you just summed up probably the most common issue infjs have with being around people hm interesting that part about your entj brother brought to mind recent friendship just formed with an entj it was surprising how easily he took my advice almost like was an embodiment of through conversation with an enfp had before and comment that struck me somewhere on the internet our inner life is what the enfp outer life is like essentially from what ve read 1 how would you react to someone saying you re an odd weird person shrug and smile if like them ll show them more weirdness if don i move on 2 how would you react if guy girl m with ideal here my approach is that ultimately you answer to yourself after all the expectations the appreciation the one person you have to reckon with is yourself then end up asking omg this so much thank you also yes to songs songs on 50 repeat same day to the point that you know the lyrics by heart intonation everything o_o probably defining your emotions this isn really an answer more of thought that came to mind when read your post read somewhere in this forum that there no such thing as right person wrong time just wrong people d rephrase martyrs then to victimizers or even whiners e people who play the woe is me card aurelief you might like this one then who the hell says m insert compliment nessawildcard hm do see the similarities m with lostie823 in wondering whether or not this is just correlation or if it could be indicative of something bit deeper or you could make new thread so that intherockies can have piece too i echoing aurelief and windblownair here look for place that not many people know about that has nice view and can be quite quiet preferably close to water or high up with view of water ditto to all though what aurelief said about being unexpectedly popular is surprisingly true haha think the unexpected bit is from personal view as in in my case don think d be popular getting it back on the tracks then i with deejaz think m all 3 depending on who m with or what feel like showcasing at the moment for example with certain friends who echoing everyone here especially what plutonicmind said about un attaching tend to know very quickly if m going to like people or not based on the situation find myself in there are hiya pantali d be down for this too rubikscubix tend to do this with one on one interactions more than public speeches but often leave conversations with the other person feeling charged more power to you bro jumping in here again follow you around sometimes now because of that post you made in the enfp forums 3 what you just described is pretty much ni the way see it that kind of exactly ditto to this this beneath the velvet gloves is an iron fist m nice because want to be not because m bound to be hmmm from the outside in so would more accurate picture be you see the possibilities with ne then you judge based on how you feel about them with fi lay them out on framework with te let me see if can help out then the way see it ni works by grabbing ton of data points via se this data is then analyzed via ti then presented alongside any information present in the fe here where it gets fun ve learned to phrase my thoughts differently depending on the audience with leaning towards saying probably maybe or most likely it only when my thought going on tangent here what about people you feel you were destined to meet would you believe just figured this out less than an hour ago thanks to friend the source of the problem seems to be the shadow fi which can be understood as the sense of self theorized for me can see how use all 4 the way explain how work is this se my 4th picks up information unconsciously from the surroundings 4th function for me is unconscious this is then gotta post again this is too accurate to pass up and eye opening definite yes to playing the part can go from uncaring just woke up look to dressed to kill and feeling like it in teacher it happened to me before but very rarely is it few days later for me it tends to be so far in the future that forget until it happens and get very eerie sense of deja vu gonna jump in here again from my understanding of ne there is no end to the alphabet only infinite possibility also from your previous post regarding socionics don know much about it hi dubbs thank you for posting this seems quite like tricky situation have you met her personally also it seems you re stressing about this and rightfully so but have you tried ksara hmmm on such shallow level forgive me for saying so but there isn much to go by your tendencies do seem to point towards intj in this case with ni te fi se but might be wrong probably closest to antipode here recently ve paid more attention to how look but that because there a reason but we always have reasons don we otherwise as long as pass the think m closest to how 11thnight describes it it ll depend entirely on the situation if it your regular run of the mill everyday scenario m pretty content and flat but when and that is exactly why agree with cmart tests are nice and all but it an attempt to statistically capture something that by its very essence cannot be captured by statistics ksara what functions are you aware that you re using from the sounds of it you seem lot like an infj maybe because the way you describe stuff is pretty similar to how would m noticing that to be true with quite bunch of different personality types actually this is very eye opening to me don know any intps personally wanna be friends i can resist it anymore this very post tells me you re not infj there is no crossing the rubicon or decision to be made you are either infj or you re not it just dawns on you as m sure going to jump in here but this seems more like ni se would you be able to give us more examples moonlight02 m going to echo everyone here and say exactly the same thing if your relationship is negatively affecting you and you can deal with it let it go no not the frozen reference d have to respectfully disagree with this the way see it this is something lover can do and it probably simultaneously the most infuriating and the most freeing thing in the world for both perfect seducers indeed cool ironically used to be so afraid of this because of how well it worked now use it on those that ask for it and whom m sure can handle it until the blasphemy m with liquidlucy on this one can be so cold and stone faced come across as unfeeling all depends on situation really ',\n",

time 2 years and possibly more if the situation called for it 4 get sense of what they need and then do it 5 for ve dealt with an infj for two years and know all too well about the hot and cold behaviour what worked for me because we re still kinda friends was to continue being myself keep sharing be no never ve been infatuated with an infj for two years now and even though it slow going the thought of abandoning my feelings for said person breaks my heart and we re not even in 1 would you ever consider going bungee jumping skydiving yes but would probably chicken out in the moment 2 would you ever consider getting plastic surgery yes if it was medical 1 love is complete acceptance 2 find out their love language and do it with sincerity 3 find out my love language and do it with sincerity an intp wondered why it was so hard to say what was on my mind but just disappeared without trace would you have done the same thing contemplated discretely posting it on my instagram as my be direct but not pushy let her know you like her but there no pressure you still be around to be her friend and she can take all the time she needs if she needs to stuff like that 88153 sorry for

in common oh yea get what you mean tend to jump into things as well because im really impatient to go thru any type of trial or first steps just want to get to the final step now he most likely likes you those are the same exact ways would probably react to someone had crush on this is very funny the ones know can hold the biggest grudge for the longest and it eats them up inside it like just spill it out and get over it and you ll be mad but then it ll go away learn the best by actually doing it so guess technically that what you do too otherwise maybe watching someone else do it ok if someone was trying to be with said things like that to me would most likely cut ties with them she pretty much said in black and white if she could fix it and be with him she would so that this reminded me the other day broke couple plates at work and my boss seen lol feel really bad about it after will try to be extra helpful and nice to make up for mistake if you really like this girl you guys will get thru this ve never been in situation like that so can relate much but d figure as long as she didn do anything too drastic and if she this is kinda funny reminded me that m always merging words together sometimes when my mouth moves faster than my mind like the other day said wanted to go see my prescriptionist instead of m currently dating an infj for just about year now so this is going to be an opinion based on him and maybe few infjs ve known here and there but mostly him since the others wasn that agree with what she said about us needing to experience things ourselves to actually get it think it cause need to feel for myself cause can never really know what d do in situation was thinking about this the other day sometimes can be the smoothest talker in the room other times can seem really off the beat as much as hate to agree with this do before you go into painting music drawing get day job first you are fine the way you are you don have to explain yourself to anyone for any reason you are as good person as the next guy so no need to over analyze yourself just be yourself and everything the more over the top the better lol d say you should write letter and read it to them in person why do you like interacting with people so much because it makes me feel great to learn about people and laugh and have great conversation can think about people are probably the biggest part put jedi cause they always win lol and don think could go around and murder innocent people like the sith do right yea do the same thing the initial feeling will be like grr m so mad and then eventually calm down and either forget about it or realize it isn such big deal to me anymore since the yea know how that trying to inform without hitting that line where you call it bragging don really find much of problem with this mean in job interview the point is to make yourself out to be the best choice for the job so yea m gonna sell out as much of my good points as yea find myself usually great at making people laugh but then there those who don get my humor this is like exactly what would of responded with am dating an infj now and can irritate him sometimes cause ask if he upset or happy or sad or just generally how is feeling things don think have much of problem with forgiving people maybe when the incident first happens may not forgive soon but eventually always seem to give people another chance depending on the it funny cause m with this introverted guy now and he tells me go into social mode when around other people don think it for attention it for me if that makes sense lol but just feel the same exact way well m in relationship now but before it was like if find one cool if don i happy with me d look around at people who longed for this great relationship and my dad is istp mom esfj don think was screwed over by them they are and still are great parents and respect them so much sure maybe we aren close like can be with type people but m in culinary arts school and love it when lady walks into an elevator with you and she is holding your favorite candy and you say omg love those and she hands you the whole thing someone values just got rumbled very interesting survey thing 1 what is your gender male 2 what is your enneagram including wing don know 3 what is your instinct variant don know 4 what is your tritype don i can agree with this lol am cheapskate lot of people know this ve dealt with many messed up people and learned thankfully when was younger about being too generous so now m very yea remember one of my favorite games as young kid was pretending was someone else yea agree with that because we know ourselves better yea and the funniest part was that it always felt bad about being an ass after the fact so it was like double edged sword lol this was back when was around 10 13 but what weird is before then no don think ve ever experienced anything like that when feel myself gettin closer to someone at least maybe not as dramatic when have this closey type of convos with other people just can think of one word asshole lol think enfps can go throw so many different moods so there is chance you could be that type when m alone for awhile actually right now might be an example as m posting this feel more currently have several type friends and the good thing with them is that they can just be plain fun to be around and see how they react to things but its like there has to be more than just one agree with m horrible at sticking to things think every type has something that admire everyone has strengths and weaknesses and it so interesting to see how different people interact with each other act on your impulses don think about it just do it sometimes it really hard for me to do the things know need to do cause have that oh ll just do it little later attitude know that idk why but this is funny lol think it could be lot of things can relate to him though but wouldn consider it problem since know it just how am and it not that serious to the point where won talk about guilty as charged can be very promiscuous guy but at the same time when find that right person can be extremely committed enjoy the idea of getting sample of different people but at the yes agree with homosexually being touched on in early schooling so that it isn this weird taboo especially to younger kids don think this would stop gays from being targeted by bullies but growing pair can mean different things to lot of people so that is kind of weird thing to say to problem like this seems like the easy answer but like that cliche saying goes it easier it kinda hard to say cause when m with someone actually do want to express some kind of feelings for the flirting comes so naturally don notice m doing it it like just become i like to flirt because it can be cute way to communicate if the other person thinks it means m seriously interested well flirting isn a serious thing to me can tell when someone is interested in me easily but it takes me to actually have some sort of friend connection with them first but once you guys start talking if you both click than m sure ',\n",

is pretty normal for infps and think the answer is that it takes time do think we have different set of ha loved your comment about nts my bf is an intj and yup he jokes think he joking about world domination heh if it makes you feel better have or have had in the past most of those same thought patterns was particularly intrigued by your mention on the excellent intuition that sometimes is can relate to this creating is my passion as well but there are many ways of being creative career wise it can be one of those things that ebbs and flows what mean is there are lot of remember thinking like that with my first love it didn work out and became pretty jaded for while but got past it and ve gotten some of that back just tempered with more caution it sounds like you ve found something really special it sounds like it just that she been hurt before and is trying to play it little safer think with patience you will be okay yes would go to him but the problem with thinking about it from that perspective is that like you am an infp her thoughts processes might be entirely different it sounds like she needs to your last post clarifies lot in the original post got the impression that you didn know lot about yourself and really hadn done much introspection yet your most recent post paints i agree that lot of this is probably being off the medication antidepressants can have side effects and some of these can include the person taking them being more emotionally muted being tired to the op think she is still unsure maybe ambivalent but maybe having feelings toward you that her head is unsure she is ready to handle well it sounds like she trying to do what she thinks m starting to feel more enthusiasm about my job career in software at the moment in part because the project was working on that hated ended and in part because came across something that i took the enneagram test that personality cafe has didn realize they had one and got 4w5 which also seemed to fit so think know that now too okay think get it now looked into my tritype took this test enneagram tritype and figured it out the test did cost 10 but it helped with my confusion on this am 4 tritype 461 took both the first test and the second one and got different results for the first got 6w7 as my top result and for the second got 4w3 as my top result both main results seem to fit me hi was wondering about free online tests to find out my enneagram type and any interesting additional information like wings and such read about the enneagram years ago but don remember think that it may be that your perspectives on this are not as completely in opposition as it might at first appear think that there is an important point made in the first post quoted in that work in software and it kind of mixed for me there are parts of it that love for the most part working has been more enjoyable than school the creative projects learning new technology got enfj for ideal and infp for real but while do sometimes wish were more outgoing and organized when it comes right down to it would rather be the type that am and learn to develop don know what her motivations are maybe she just wants everybody to spend time together maybe she has an ulterior motive like testing whether you will get jealous but most likely she just dogs as kid would have said both and most other animals too for while as an adult would have said none think too much of that kind of energy was going to parenting and didn have think to put this all down to type is to oversimplify it that being said have some of the same issues with my intj bf just to lesser degree thankfully we have both had to work to other people have already said this but no you re not horrible person it is very common for people to have sex again after breakup it was at time that she was vulnerable yes but it sadly relate to this ve gotten better at accepting the world as it is and finding parts that fit me but there are days when want to scream and think most people don get it mean it reminds me of an ally mcbeal episode georgia asks ally what makes your problems so much bigger than everyone else and ally says they re mine lol thanks used to think the way you do but see so many people around me in worse situations and it makes me think should just force myself to make it work plus the more learn about infps understand what you mean though think right now am on the other side of the scenario feel frustrated with my job meanwhile there are people know who have it so much worse that feel used to love it there was enough new to learn and enough that was creative that really enjoyed it but lately it has been lot of boring detail work and it feels like every time think m think maybe you are taking type little too much

the tips we ve given m sure you ll get be fine thanks are you trying to befriend an intj or is this out of curiosity im terrible at math ve got great social skills im quite religious im pretty

talk about the weather and recipies im very similar always searching for life altering information as you put it read book called the 48 laws of power by robert greene recently and found it amazing

top 5 characteristics good sense of humour keep up an intellectual conversation with moi oozes confidence genuine ambitious top 5 physical features feel like that most of the time typically describe moiself as boring and always look for someone who is fun to compliment moi boring nature cant imagine anything worse than two boring admit do sometimes brood over past failures but at the same time always make sure to draw as many lessons from them to prevent it from occuring again used to feel down and stuck can definately relate to your dislike of being depended upon cant bear it dont mind helping but as soon as feel as though they need moi or cant live without moi pull away need were you involved in sports or the arts played as little sport as could get away with and m creative but didnt take on art dating was never that interested in boys to actually date have in on moi social media profiles but dont actually verbally tell people m an intj yes think do intimidate people ve often been told that m intimidating especially by members of the opposite sex it not intentional though usually dont like to recieve gifts from people am upset with feel like it a bribe sincere apology is good enough gift for moi when ask for advice emotional or not usually already know what want to do m just looking for an alternate point of view to see if ve perhaps missed something cant speak for other angryangryhippo has basically summed it up now if you re lucky you ll get coordinates however suggest you find another type to stalk i always get told that m too serious and think too much also dont laugh that easily moi friends are always frustrated by that they ll joke and all ll say is thats so funny with how do you guys interact with people in general what is the difference between how you interact with strangers with strangers m charming and extremely polite but dont indulge conversation dont cry often cant remember the last time cried out of hurt for moiself tear up now and then when read book or see movie with sad ending or if see or hear something that affects those words pretty much sum up what do as well can see it and then do whatever needs to be done many of moi friends question how can be so sure and moi answer is always know it will there was guy was once interested in briefly and m pretty sure he was an enfp intellectually he was great to talk to but full of insecurities and feelings that was major turn off so on think am prettier than average but obviously no knock out m happy as am and yes many people get the wrong impression of moi at first im not as talkative or approachable as seem at have nothing profound to say just that you re probably good looking many people look past your behaviour if you have pretty exterior so your sudden change in personality probably added to whew have 34 quencie surprising how as intj we got average scores on empathy thank you i definately write book and set up some kind of foundation then spend moi days researching for moi book and managing the foundation whats the big deal about us being arrogant anyway it not like we re going to change if people talk about it 5 10 like the contrast of rainbow against black background wierdly enough all moi friends are extroverts and quite emotional m not sure how ended up friends with all of them lol the thing they do that makes moi laugh the most is when they launch into the above mentioned things really get to moi as well and agree with your sentiments along with that however is also when people tell moi that need to lower moi standards because they think find what you say very true moi mom and sister are extroverts and very emotional stand out in stark comparison to their ever changing moods and flowing conversation appear too serious and how important is action for you putting the strategy or goals into action its quite important for moi as soon as m satisfied with the overall plan initiate it with action as soon as usually smile and if the person doesnt beat moi the the greeting usually say hey for moi the cup is definately full dont think the world fits into box it too collectively too vast but there are facets of it that could be boxed into smaller compartments to make up the whole it always awesome to meet an extraordinaire thanks for the welcome by the way hey brilliant idea we really are m honoured to make you aquaintance usually imagine moi future in very precise and vivid detail and control everything in it i not natural at math and to this day struggle with what others would consider simple on the other hand im very good with language knowledge individuality religion achievement purpose ideals and family jackparrish thank you for that as young intj really appreciate the effort you ve made to help guide us into

putting on shoes is lot of work is really kind of just curious but do enfjs have anything to say on infj females vs infj males know ton of enfjs absolutely adore all the male enfjs know even when they re annoying and over fe have dear enfj boss okay you re officially on my nice list by which mean think the world of you and you re awesome and like you lots funny thing after actually chatting with you for bit had the biggest crush on an enfj guy for two years he was one of my good friends and was always really touchy feely and adorably friendly he was fairly protective and on top of everything else captain america is an sj in my opinion an isj think you re right about the fe though isfj and lily evans always struck me as an enfp but haven put much thought into it sorry off well here another infj perspective my grandpa an istj m not that close to him and doubt ever will be he nice m nice we make small talk occasionally he cleans the pool and dear istp you re really cool it awesome watching you gain confidence and mature and ask really hard questions and think it really cool you re making an effort to find answers also going dear istp m really excited to go to the game with you and your friend on saturday that going to be loads of fun and hopefully won look too out of place in stadium if do m sure ha told her what you said here about asking the guy out and she blushed and said she didn feel right about that and she doesn think it how relationships should be love her lot and honestly really don care enough to reply to your points as don see point we ve gotten way off topic and think we both have better ways to spend our time than debating things that thank you for sharing this know very little about autism but want to learn more now my younger cousin was autistic when he was very little through therapy he regained his ability to haha nope no banging involved especially not in front of her she implode from the immorality anyway there were two of them and that not quite my style nope she scared to ask the guy she likes out because she doesn know if he likes her back and she never bring over guy for anything other than watching tv or grabbing her purse before going for the record part of skillful communication is to convey your message in such way that it comes across the way you want it to when you use phrases like mere mortals and you re intending only am one such feeler believe as is she after living with her for seven months can definitely see her then you should say what you mean that way won take what you say in the wrong way and there will be no need for clarification because the meaning will be clear also if they only appear to used word you did not to describe something see as the same thing as what you said you described entj women as such letting others take advantage of you which you said in the bionic thank you that was very helpful as said know next to nothing about socionics except the little ve read in articles bored fairly easily on that subject originally and haven and there isn i was referring to your description of entj women at any rate think this conversation is going nowhere think what you want and ll think what will and it all good with that being said do test as an infp and as far as know so do many infjs know very little about socionics although think have more than solid grasp on mbti types do not transfer infjs in mbti generally transfer to infp in socionics infj and entj actually are supervisor supervised in socionics it infp and entj that are semi duality in socionics understand that and can see that being true of some entj women and anyone in stressful leadership position depending on who she is don think you can generalize entj women to be pushovers dear isfp sister love you lots that being said communication is important if say next thursday need the car don call me in panic on thursday when take the car because you your stated opinions don your conversation style and willingness to be confrontational do just by contrast you ve strengthened my thinking that she is an enfj m not saying this to be sarcastic understood and respect your opinion when you phrase it like that however given my knowledge of cognitive functions which admit is incomplete although quite good and my seven months of that makes sense ve been in both situations and think it accurate more or less well aren we pissy today know some things about quite few things but don claim to know everything however in this situation would say have better claim to know my roommate type no but am my roommate turned out to be an enfj so it not quite the same however one of my very best friends is an estj and it be quite feat to take advantage of her correct me if m wrong but they seem like they could take care of themselves rolleyes yeah the more look at her the less see any sign of te saw enxj very clearly and she kept insisting she was logical person which she is she just even more highly emotional so it took me yeah sincere apology can work wonders on me and learned at an early age that saying sorry to my mother infp even when wasn sorry would get me out of trouble really quickly that makes haha sorry bud m pretty convinced she an enfj now have tendency to be more blunt than she is say something point blank and she looks shocked that wouldn filter my language to make actualized type infj preferred type infj attraction type entj sounds about right don know any entjs well but one of my best friends in an estj ve always thought d like guy like have couple xstp friends estp male istp female she a couple years older than him but for while he was really interested in her she knew because he not really capable of subtlety at dear estp you re adorable especially when you talk about football because honestly have no idea what you re saying but you get really excited and animated and that the greatest thing ever dear weather thank you you are lovely today my tank top and had great run and enjoyed the sunshine love sweaty but happy infj dear under armour tank top you re my best running dear intj cousin sorry can hang out this weekend love you lots and have fun shopping ll see you sometime soonishly hope love bestest infj cousin on the planet dear estp okay agree on edward definitely infj when think it through bella she an i originally thought infj especially in the first book m not going off the movies all the acting is crap m actually could see edward being infj as well bella infj edward intj jacob estp charlie istj renee esfp alice enfj esme isfj carlisle isfj as well don know emmett esfp jasper isfx definitely my estp plays soccer and football and runs track ve only managed to make it to one game which feel bad about because if could d go to all of them but it really fun watching that makes lot of sense every so often he expresses this subtle desire to be understood most of the time he content to be loud and bouncy but once in while he talks about it we were hanging in high school one of my best guy friends was an esfp he had lot of positive qualities great at giving hugs seriously all had to do was say dustin need hug and he bear hug me ',\n",
              " ' answered you can thank my fnj ness for that ah ok kind of see what you re saying think we can break this down into parts first we should be clear that the correlation on the mbti of with and with indicates tendency not hmm ok so m going to ramble bit and take this in personal direction before bringing it back to more impersonal level with regard to personality disorders used to think that my when was younger and lived in place where it was more dangerous to be out pride fest parade had certain unity and fight to them bit of nervous defiant celebratory energy nowadays wow this has been very stimulating thread for me thanks everyone massive post coming up you ve been warned completely agree sedem fucking fill me in ok have no idea why you said that in response to my post would you care to clarify when think of bullying think of my experiences in high school and middle school which were relational in that my future estp best friend turned our entire shared friend group against me so here something ve observed in myself and in other people who are infj which includes multiple people in my own life and in several people online who identify as infj what ve observed is the tendency to feel negative emotions or to have broader range of emotions is categorized under the neuroticism or emotional lability vs stability or sometimes called limbic calm dimension seems pretty clearly nf probably infp although wouldn be surprised by infj or enfp enfj would be hard sell for me it always nice to have another enfp on perc welcome thanks everyone shucks blushed ellis bell you are the biggest sweetheart and by far my favorite forumite thanks for posting this rarest female _ntjs next rarest male infj nj are humanity four leaf clovers something already knew from life experience would feel bad for the female really resonated with this thread yep that the one ellis bell said something insightful about fi and nardi test in another thread it certainly possible that you are intp and hey inxp might also be good label if you think it fits assuming the percentages for the other dimensions were not similarly ambiguous that would be consistent with an intx type the step results you posted likewise suggest that your j preference is you re welcome the reason you got two types is because your t preference came out exactly 50 50 so here a great example of why thinking in black and white terms might not be helpful so while oh god m going to need lot of alcohol in my system before can click through all of that cognitive function tests are fucking mess even dario nardi who claims that functions are measurable thing in the brain can even design test in which for example intjs are more likely to actually you might be interested to know that many of the test items for the j dimension are dirty and they get what they deserve uh ahem what mean by that is that there is an influence oh no am about to be put on an ice floe it people soylent green is made out of people o_o just type the at sign followed by the username perc figures out the rest teybo if you want to get complicated there a mention tag but ve never used it so don know how it still have aids so you should get back to work my cancer is gone wow in my opinion the poor quality of online tests themselves probably play larger factor in so called mistypes than self bias although some misunderstanding about one own preferences does have hahaha well yeah wasn referring to letting mbti decide dating or career choices so much as referring to getting targeted advice about possible dating or career obstacles or refining your actually research has shown that people who have more pronounced preference than preference tend to be forceful or dominant while people whose preference is stronger than their preference the idea that infjs don have strong inner compass is misconception stemming from nonsense people say about the cognitive functions additionally the idea that infj should identify more with just to clarify in case it not clear my posts in this thread are not comment on whether like or dislike sj but an observation that there is stark contrast between how sj are talked about was mostly referring to the fact that modern life seems to be much more set up for some types than other types think there is probably some personality privilege afforded to some types akin it sounds like you are searching between infj and intj if you are interested this thread contains many many good discussions of infj intj and the influence of gender on t this post by with threads like these you always need to add the distinction internet overrated underrated vs real life overrated underrated trust me istj are not underrated in real life lady lullaby totally get what you mean about wanting to beam your insights into other people heads visual typing is pretty much bullshit agree j can be incredibly illuminating it gets ragged on for some really undeserved reasons mostly relating to people placing more emphasis on some nebulous meaning of function hierarchy could be infj but could also be infp no this is the key thing was referring to when spoke of the elegance of myers approach function talk is hyper focused on nit picking small differences between people who are largely similar and ultimately think large part of the chaos of function talk has to do with people misunderstanding jung vision and isabel myers vision that was inspired by jung there is so much function talk phoenixpinion since you ve oscillated between number of types over the last few weeks perhaps you are the perfect candidate to answer your own question liminalthought shh don tell anyone full text edit for what it worth the spousal correlation on the s dimension is just striking reckful some days go back and forth on my t preference since there are some sub traits on which fall closer to than i think it strong evidence that m an that can really yeah am not good at explaining what mean maybe if relate where this idea came from it might help my beloved infp sister told me that she can usually see people motivations within 5 don see what the point is of engaging acerbusvenator if his single minded goal is to elevate himself above others why bother to correct his mistakes if he only in it for his ego love you acerbusvenator you misstate my position and then belittle me based on conjecture that stands in contradiction to the overwhelming weight of hundreds of thousands of data points collected over you didn understand what was saying if that what you think said said it was likely that your preference on t was closer to the middle than either extreme end which you confirmed i am wondering if it is tendency for infp to have clear vision of another person or situation and flow around it or negotiate the space rather than directly confront it as in vocalize if you re insistent on only reading about cognitive functions well first d say that you re unnecessarily limiting yourself and then would suggest reading lenore thomson personality type an ',\n",

              " ' m not denying that it natural m simply stating that it not necessary which most parents and kids think it is very necessary to try and make their fathers or mothers proud before doing what d say it strict parenting not exactly love by definition they have become so oppressed for such long time by their own parents and had such ridiculous subjectivity drilled and literally yes do but that not my point my point is setting high standards for your own child to achieve and if they don exactly achieve them then you disown them as your own or feel ashamed and could empathize with that sure d have to disagree with last statement well at least for the older generation remember my mom telling me that don care if my mother beat me didn take care of me cursed at me and came let look at the synonyms here then arrogance haughtiness vanity conceit glory boast any of these terms are rarely used in good or optimistic manner towards another person except for maybe don think it anyones place to exactly decide what bad value is for all we know that person could feel eating cake at 10 30 pm on sunday is bad value let look at the definition of pride feeling or deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one own achievements the achievements of those with whom one is closely associated or from while that good and all don you think that this validation should be more subjective than necessity that you should spend your entire life trying to work towards if parent doesn you know that scene in movies and books where the father father figure says x93ix92m proud of youx94 for the first time and itx92s supposed to be this big emotionally powerful moment of release where the it doesn matter it just something ve been noticing lot lately especially when thewickedqueen was having the debate with the retired entp pages ago pun intended and everyone was very biased understand the psycho guy part but it seems as if you almost want everything we say to be sugar coated or fawning towards how great good the esfj is because as am going through these pages m to me it as simple as getting off your ass and doing what you want to do m only lazy towards other peoples wishes like if someone told me to do something for them may be slow to act if it i a boxer so naturally have to run everyday as soon as wake up in the morning do 100 push ups and 100 sit ups then after that 2 hours of rigorous exercise rest for 1 then off to the gym those kids are idiots so therefore can help be apathetic towards something like this everything they say means absolutely nothing they aren worth neuron firing ve always seen that kid as kind of immature esfp rather than an immature esfj but guess the esfj is little more prone to gossip scratches head ok so you dug your information from different source than did how is this information more accurate than 90 of other sources irony which all state different percentile letx92s not make fun of anything ever letx92s just be full of infinite compromise and understanding why did the chicken cross the road hey man thatx92s pretty narrow minded not all actually that the best way studying up on the functions and typing people yourself instead of relying on confusing online test it make sense for sj to be at least the majority of the same functions all in different order and used in different way just how an entj and an estj use their top two functions differently than each other the infj infp and esfj are no different that article pretty much raises the exact same points that made but it seems as though just because that from an official source and because mine isn that my point is apparently skewed and it appears so seeing as how the infj and infp usually have hard time finding themselves being outcast and all that article pretty much sums up what was trying to say well most of this is based on keirsey theories and also jung mixed in with little bit of my own analysis by reading the news and observing the people around me and am not certain but think don believe the esfj is hated by all types and believe that there are certain type of esfj that are hated which are mainly the strict illogical mother who tell you that you can go to ok yeah agree with you to an extent every type sort of has their own individual way of raising their kids the esfj is no differet so that being said it pretty easy to decipher an mbti type was waiting for someone to misinterpret my post m not implying anything m simply pointing out what each temperament represents and why they are hated not why they should be hated if the nt actually it is if you read through and have thorough understanding of all the functions you could easily distinguish an fe dom user from an fi dom user it not as impossible as you like to no actually morality is the problem people trying to force their traditions and beliefs on other people thinking it will help us reach some kind of utopian society when in actuality it creating see it seems you guys are looking more at the first 4 letters rather than the cognitive functions themselves well developed ti helps because it is basically the process of breaking down every exactly nobody want to deal with their own negative qualities when it being directed towards them so of course they hate it the thing is esfj and the whole sj temperament make up half of with the help of well developed ti function it pretty easy to determine my avatar is john constantine from dc hellblazer comics he a con artist magician and anti hero he was created by alan moore steve bissete and

five minutes arguing point until someone backs you up only for their manner of agreeing to annoy you in some small way so then you argue against their reasoning instead so we all share the common personality type entp on this forum my question how do you perceive people take on your persona my understanding is that people see me as an unpredictable when got my lexapro prescription from general practitioner at the university health services my doctor asked me what 5 htp was if wasn aware that d get serotonin syndrome and die if i don mean to be argumentative or defensive but my annoyance just comes from cookie cutter assumptions about diagnostics most strictly physical ailments have high degree of variability but and does he fit your limited stereotype of people with aspergers based off of the limited number of friends you have with the syndrome okay well m just going to disregard any further attacks towards my self diagnosis since ve already sufficiently explained my reasonable view towards it you guys have very limited view of the dude for sure remember in elementary and middle school kids who didn know me would try to pick on me and either 1 someone else would step in and tell the person to piss off or 2 they callie you obviously have missed the points that 1 don care about the diagnosis the framework of the syndrome describes numerous life experiences for me 2 there are more specific examples that a good rule of thumb ll keep that in mind guess the name doesn matter as much as the understanding though some argue it just another genotype rather than condition just businessman the literal joke thing had horribly as child my confidence was super super low because felt like wasn liked by anyone because couldn read neutral face expressions if you ve been even an occasional visiter to the entp forum these past few months there a good chance you ve noticed my little existential crisis over my first term at college or perhaps the term hmm guess just mention liberal arts because to my knowledge any other kind of college is more specialized and therefore has less of variety in its student body and perhaps less of traditional if your experience is anything like mine then thousand times over yes can only vouch for university of michigan and michigan state but think the same might go for any liberal arts college huh quite life parallel we have only messed up big this term so m excited for the next one because it a chance to redeem myself where do you go out of curiosity greetings fellow entps m taking quick break from cramming for personality psych

              " ' ive recently had several sleep paralyses while having nightmares its kind of amazing but awful when saw it on the tv was like wow then was like thats so cool then looked at all the people dropping form the building was amazed thinking what itd be like to fall from there bat they are more intelligent than humans and the only chores youd need to do is catching bugs you do realize killing others is normal for animals how is that different from us we are just like animals but with technology how can you overlook the brutality that nature documents prove oh my always wanted to know which it is the void or the otherworld yay get to know it now tail swaying with excitement what would the world be like what do you think the world would be like if it were the intj who were most common alright so this thread isnt explicit to infp but thought it has the most meaning to us so what do you think is unique and what is not do you strive for it in way or another if so does this look good on me wouldnt know should put my scarf the other way your hosting an alcohol drinking party count me in we are going to take walk on this great sunny day im in tritype is so cool its shame that its hoccus poccus like astrology think time is essence would not waste thinking my time is useless its what live for my time that is if you oppose what gives your life its essence then you dont want to know what i would criticise you but there are too many isfp alright so we all have irrational areas whats yours for me the question of who am is the area where im most irrational in can easily type others but when the question comes to my but got tired think its estp 5w4 so sx so sx are known for their contemplative nature why estp is cause well looking at my profile it seems like the stereotypical estp gone wild has written it mean well those who see me know that tend to change my typings all the time was just thinking that theres no enneagram am worthy enough to poses sniff cant be that wouldnt live am seriously getting angry with this time after time feel empathy without knowing its empathy mess up my whole world by making decisions in my thinking according to how someone else alright so is this the bane to you as well ive found great value from subjective thinking but it took me like life time to realize that theres value in it soo what about you to well used to make alot of threads but dont any more alright dont think im the only one so anyone has ideas on how to spend time in the webs and stuff ahh any skype rooms on perc cant find any interesting threads in perc enfj insane cult leader oh are you referring to obama what about the inventor of atom bomb intp alright the title says it tell us of unlikely evil possible traits associated with type xxxx ill start infj the angels at worst blinded by vengeful hatred towards people who arent laser hands so could kill anyone who smokes what does it look like own an alien laser pistol or what but ive done it with over 5 dragons of both gender wolfhuman thingie oh and oh mean this all counts right alright so do you personally correlate emotions to ennea like person of xwz is more likely to feel this and that so feel free to blabber thats what this thread is for no idea imagine you know it since its your idea have no idea what this is but voted yes infp two plastic bags its fine trekking bag that use for shopping in the local market hitler or jesus hard to say alchemy jesus changed water into wine change youghurt into cannabis id put the whole tritype into same category as astrology in other words believe the whole tritype theory exists only because we all can pretend other enneas as fluently as if we really were simple mathematics each ennea has 5 attributes the must be at least one superego in each ennea to have three enneas in one person would mean that tehre are people with six superegoes or six think youre from whole different planet than you dont grasp my words dont grasp your words think its quite fascinating looked your profile an intj that ni te thinking can be you cant tell hmm that must be joke you have over 14000 posts and you still think that the opposite wings are that similar why couldnt any ennea find their id obscure look ego is separate from id in all enneas they way the way experience id is as if it was completely irrelated to me just feel that there are wants either observe them or analyze them dont relate to my wants at all and to begin with see you dont grasp what im talking of never said its enneagram 8w7 or 8w9 it could be any enneagram with ties to ennea 8 thats what im talking of do not think its shallow to alright let me explain im here quite confused because dont believe tritype to be real why it would mean that there are people with six superegoes could never imagine that being possible so you only find your eye targets only mildly attractive would too if talked about humans dragons however alright so this thread isnt what you woudl first think when you read the title what this thread is careful analysis how different morals can be correlated to different ennea attributes so alright say what ennea is the hottiest and say why no whys means out whys so say why this is specificly the word hottiest my answer is easy 5w4 you have seen the movie eragon then the welcome text since you arent figuring it out yourself you must be sensor tell me do you play electronic games yes means and no means in the games do you own or are you mostly when its related to how amaze others through finding witfulness from areas others wouldnt quite stereotypical for 7w8 if you know of us mean technically my ego is 5 which means compliments regarding how proper am or of how intelligent am dont really thrive through compliments if know it myself thats enoguh it seems people feel this too as dont really hmm im not quite sure that grasp the difficultiness of such situation could imagine having need to be with others but as long as just can lay down mean literally not mating then im ahh let me check about two years however ive been some more years into typology than that do have friends in my friend list though dont use that list much im quite shy ive been oh you love me is that compliment slap to the face always look at this thread while browsing new posts and _dont_ think but think without thinking dont think im trying to browse these threads how could think while doing so purpose its fascinating concept think gave up on purpose years ago after lost all hope live on something else now something intanglible as think do not find any purpose but they dont quite the opposite of the word you used if you want an insta ban and moderator to laugh his ass off yes it seems not people tend to be quite pervy also another help

              " ' sure male isfjs tend to put up an unemotional side prefer logic over feelings due to the expectations of society of being male in addition to that most isfjs do not want to share their well if you don count anime stuff then pop is just blunder famous artists sing songs for anime op ed ost and lot of pop is dominated by anime vocaloid stuff just see nico nico douga hmm perhaps the isfj you are meeting is has put external thinking while deep down he a feeler lot of male isfjs are like that as to fit in the male stereotype since we are usually described don think addiction is always negative but it sure can be and is perceived as mean addicted to helping people is good thing right and addicted to happiness is neutral as it neither yep just add dress there and it perfect m sorry let me rephrase that you would look even cuter well uniqlo been my brand of choice ever since came to japan it definitely worth try though and that is all your cuteness honestly what believe there is no such thing as good christian catholic wife there is only good wife mean m an isfj and understand that you want to be good wife like an isfj is hey hey let me tell you secret here you want cheap clothes but with good quality and design right look no further other than uniqlo since it a japanese brand lot of people in japan hahahah yep if you count getting lost in the streets for 3 hours it is definitely fun for me it is faced money problems though 2 years ago while visiting japan as went to akihabara 3 very rarely insult someone now unless they have really really angered me which is again once in 3 years before though during my early puberty days insult anybody who gets angry at me oh m not from japan but travel there usually every summer just for fun and to learn their language summer school went to korea because my mom got into the drama craze my brother gf should have been born in japan swear could meld there so easily love their food and culture follow their customs unknowingly like bowing heads never shouting or those asian stereotype well the only surefire way have discovered so far was to completely shut it down ve had gaming addiction for about 4 years now and it got to the point of almost ruining my life so i ve been learning japanese for 2 years and would say am lazy student can speak read and construct sentences but not at an adequate level probably n4 level should have been n3 by now alright just came back from korea and man was it exciting got lost in the streets of jeju for an hour went to nami island where the winter sonata drama was shot went with my korean friends yeah m in school too but it so competitive and stressful that my friends in general try to avoid talking about it mean in 3 people scenarios m fine as the other person could help me carry and may ask why cl is the queen love 2ne1 btw their mv are very interesting especially am the best how about kawada mami do you like her music oh good answer thank you so do you just talk about common things such as things around you to keep the conversation going as the only time can become an extrovert is when talk about my hate mainstream american music so drifted towards kpop and jpop and it was great one of my favorites is hot young bloods by park bo young think that was the title m the opposite though am not lenient to people and instead care more about animals animals listen people don i vaguely understand it now but still hate it whenever go to an argument with an emotional person keep calm in an argument say the logical things and almost all the time my reasoning is that depends on the isfj closeness relationship with their religion if the religion plays major role in shaping their life or provides more security which is mostly the case since you can fight think personally that isfjs have the need to belong and usually religion provides this belonging that they need you and value you myself am christian catholic still debating on this by you yes you that is like all the estj girls have seen usually relates to guys more loves to debate attracts the free spirited the alpha female k mom more masculine in personality but wow those are just what expected of the estj women desired traits though could you explain to me what passive aggressive and not playing the victim mean never understood it agree the best relationships start out as friendship but then when girls start to have close guy friends the girls start to lose interest in him right mean you have guy with the perfect yeah in society people generally equate intelligence with scores quite hate it but that the only surefire way to measure one ability to think critically this might be bit biased but our society have gender differentiation and being guy am always expected to start the conversation first which gets annoying sometimes ok the general rule for all isfjs is that we fear rejection no we crave acceptance from others especially our loved ones and if we don get that we go in depression mode depression mode well know at heart am an isfj male but due to society standards and views of what male should be like and the school program attend to international baccalaureate or ib feel that can you explain more about the boring and adventurous part what is boring to you and what is adventurous to you such as are they like good talker or does extreme sports stuff like that ok most of it is what expected except 6 and 7 6 came as surprise as thought estjs prefer other s due to their outgoing nature 7 though can you please elaborate best friends isn so estj women what do you prefer in mate the qualities characteristics stereotypes how they dress up etc anything also are these must hard working gets good grades in your signature please it is beautiful but it making my head dizzy back to topic see your isfj mate is healthy type the unhealthy ones are very controlling in an indirect way good job oh my mistake then just thought that since most male isfj feel that they are bit feminine they have to fit into society expectations mean male isfjs are caring nice passive reserved well male isfjs feel they have duty to conform to male gender stereotypes we on the outside express what society sees as manly but on the inside we re likely bit opposite on that don know yes create professional cold persona in public staying quiet and expressionless once in the company of friends or family though go full retard and become crazy extrovert agree with niss guys in general gain their confidence and joy through respect either from your loved ones or friends or coworkers or boss and many more respect usually defines us so we like it wow that good to know very good to know in fact wouldn want beautiful you being second place right it also shows that he definitely not an isfj since isfjs is loyal almost to their death if just to clarify it was not inappropriate touching we just do it to get laugh from friends and he sometimes teases me with pinching me painfully it hurts quite bit but don get pissed or the thing is that usually do that to him everyday just to get his reaction and he usually gets annoyed but that it was surprised when he got really angry that time rarely happens and could hmm understood is it that bad can you elaborate why so to the intps specifically the males what do you do when you get angry so in the morning was touching my intp friend though he was cranky and asked me to stop in the end just gave him hmm well then guess ll try to find out more about the other personality types thank you ooh seems like m not an anomaly thought we needed to fit exactly like the description given thanks for the heads up what this guy said you could either choose the path of safety or risk the path of danger safety means you stop trying nothing will happen yet you won feel content happy danger means you keep well ve been thinking lately some people identify themselves as isfj and isfj are usually typed as hardworking individuals who are caring nice and avoids conflict yet myself am not as seems m late to party but just wanted to give you tip keep in touch with him and reassure him that you won leave lose interest in him we need that trust that commitment as if you leave the amount of dreamers here are so much going second is explorer so much people well my results were anchor by the book buttoned

with hopeless romantic infj haha i pretty sure my dad is an estj my dad is d bag can stand how he does things or how he treats people so for me infj and estj is big no no it interesting thinking about the distribution of love between spouse and ones kids personally view it through the lens of my christian faith and my calling to be pastor because of okay you may be right but my analogy still stands if were trying to get into peoples cars d go after the ones with the window down or the doors are unlocked do you see what m getting at think agree with this guys point of view although not his method let take it to different scenario say you live in an area that has frequent situations where cars are broken into enjoy being in leadership mostly in areas that feel competent in because trust in my vision strategy and abilities when m in leadership if m not sure of what m doing can still do m fairly good at maintaining eye contact when m listening to what someone is saying think of it as way to show that m engaged and listening however when m talking tend to look haha remember doing this in high school as sophmore or junior that was what 6 or 7 years ago frick year and giving over 40 hugs it was pretty sweet just wore sign and went to this fml ve seen common thread here in regards to this pairing so have to ask the question how do infps want to be comforted counseled think this would be helpful to understand in order for an you say that like it a bad thing or something crazy ve heard really great things from this pairing from hand full of people here on the forum some of which are in happy marriage unfortunately m in similar spot as metacog except it the please don turn my thread into an apple vs whatever flame war love apple but love my service provider and how little it costs me to be with them so m not going to switch to an iphone yeah was going to say that doesn do me much good if its for the iphone sent from my sph d700 using tapatalk m using tapa talk on my android phone and when try to access forum that is multiple layers deep like the infj forum within myers briggs and nf types it gives me an error is this known error ve typically heard from various enfj that know or have met that they prefer nf types they tend to get along well with us infjs happy that last line makes me laugh because have friend or two that totally down with that haha you aren an enfj though op would say that all that enfj that know of are rather affectionate people perhaps your desire to serve and what not fits into your love language have typically it the same time wherever you go because of where you are in the world so it 11 30pm in ny and 11 30pm in la if that makes sense already saw few yesterday night before peak time tonight bet you could see few before 10 30pm go check

the feedback think infjs and enfjs have lot of the same humor and stuff the wiener idea for card is hilarious would die laughing especially if it from an enfj you enfjs so have this birthday gift idea for an enfj girl like her favorite flower is an amaryllis and thought would just get her something simple that ties in with that would actually buy the just laughed out loud at this m totally this way and have no idea what to say just don feel like anything interesting happened that day if something awesome did happen m pretty sure m surprised he waits till the last minute maybe his isn as strong as yours just thought haha m digging this thread have an enfj friend that has birthday coming up in aw thanks for the encouragement really appreciate it writing is something that really have desire to do just fail at doing it haha the blog forces me to do so in way m even if you tell them that you have feelings for them and they re not mutual could that change too do enfjs tend to have very ideal picture of someone they have in mind someone they have interest in and once they get to know them more lose interest quickly know infjs tend to like someone wow that sounds pretty spot on to me thanks for writing that all out do you guys mind if flip this question around what if you the enfj has friend and he she ends up liking you but you weren interested in that person at the time how do you respond to oh this thread was so enlightening think m following naturally doing all of those things in the lists of things enfjs need in relationship it also reassuring to know that it not ve always been hopeless romantic can remember crazy obsessions and daydreams even when was in elementary school have no idea how or why m that way or if it a bad thing for me but thanks for the tips love you enfjs like no other you re fantastic laughing would agree with the stress leading to just barking orders lacking any personal connection or consideration it actually pretty shocking when it happens not only for others but me as well i ve definitely opened up to an enfj bit more and faster than would normally feel comfortable doing but in turn think she opened up to me quite fast she still holding back for sure how do you get them to open up and feel safe enough to share their feelings is it just time and that proving that you re trustworthy and safe tend to make lists for the day week so that can cross it off and not feel overwhelmed could keep it all in my head but want to prevent forgetting or feeling overwhelmed to visually see don have problem sleeping in front of people at all used to take power naps at work in the break room for 15 mins loved having sleep overs when was younger and now crazy it i don know what that means posted in that thread too don see why it a terrible thing if want to be part of the discussion if anything m just bumping your thread to the top so it the irony of your post and personality type tongue sure do hope lot of you guys well ladies get infj

with infps have been rather awkward forced etc it requires lot of work really love enfjs and like enfps hi larious don want to be bummer or anything but have to say this while you may act more mature than some adults know this feeling you don really know what it like m 24 now and what just thinking about this makes me realize that m bit picky about my birthdays if no one acknowledges it or does something for my birthday like spending time with me going out for dinner making mine is m gonna give all my secrets away post regularly and hope some of you would interact regularly as well ',\n",

then double post swear this mobile forum app is the worst ve seen oops hold on second ve had similar responses from people regardless of gender it because of the way we sometimes tend to impart information terms people have used towards me know don quite understand what you meant by your second second but here a quick example that might help you understand what problem double standard western people are facing these days support haha you are being bit silly to be honest know plenty of isfp my brother being prime example some things are accurate but your list is very focussed on stereotype quite just had to quote this such small post yet so very true can recall endless situations from my past where people became less and less version of their real selfes when they interact in to everybody here who believes you can change the way your brain is wired just because you want to you should seriously stop and think for moment about how wrong that actually sounds no you my brother is an isfp and know that we tend to clash often where it mostly goes wrong is that as an isfp he tends to have live and let live attitude whereas am constantly looking for ok that would seem to be more of an si like approach recognizing familiar aspects from the past and building your understanding from there still we are talking about one example here which is was just reading this thread again since it had been bumped and wonder if you could elaborate more on what you perceive as different writing styles between infp and infj m hearing this more okay but how did your thought proces go did you look at some of the things he told you and looked for similarity and specific things that overlapped in your own research or did you conceptualize wouldn mind too much about your past like you said you were mentally ill and mental illness doesn have anything to do with mbti so in your case the past don know how far back is not if it is anything helpful this is very sensorish thing to say especially the last sentence you respond to the quote as if it would literally mean that two souls become one recognize this haha of course not telling people they are intelligent will often make them give you more credit m sure if the majority would be below average this thread would be full of call bs okay so lets see clickbait title amateuristic op lot of expensive words no real substance no valid source in the op misinformation about mbti claiming to be able to yea ve read that explanation but it is one of the many think and it may be caused by sort of explanations it is all guessing and possibilities that should say enough really people thank you for asking this was afraid was the only only one here who is skeptical about this whole thing to me it not only sounds ridiculous that shutting someone out of your life completely and haha think you are making this harder than it is just bring it up as joke with bit of sarcasm do it face to face though to prevent misintrepretation for example she asks you to make hehe really swear it is probably the type have seen most very easy to recognize just visit any hospital or rehabilitation center 75 of the nurses there are isfj lol administration m sorry but what don think you have met many estj or any dom aux te users in general they are the best of all types at relaying information and communicating logical arguments in concise haha this is such classic scenario this could have totally been me i definately agree on the bolded parts but m not acting that way at all nor am trying to align myself to other people standards want to be my natural self my problem is just with people lol that joke took couple of seconds to sink in suppose agree with you on the culture part live in the netherlands which is country with very big mix of nationalities and cultures and haha damnit my cover is blown runs for the hills laughing ve always been hearing it but since ve started my new job it has been more frequent than ever well that sounded enthusiastic really don get the feeling you enjoy what you are overal think they are an interesting type but they have some tendencies that annoy me from my experience intps and many other ne users tend to go off topic quickly or go on tangents and got rloai as well with these tests it is probably best not to take things literal but rather try and interpret what they try to say look you scored low on extroversion so they listed some about the same 1 or 2 topics over and over and over and over again while you are right about the social aspect of the game and how it can create positive situations for people think you are being bit naive d like to just pinpoint some of the problems have seriously don get why this is so popular the hype obviously isn because of pokemon that has been around for ages it just the new technology that gets people excited then they get haha wow speaking of trying to over analyse she is probably just shy and doesn easily approach people you approached her first and maybe you broke the ice for her so that she now more yes that is another typical trait of sensors someone actually explained this in another post in this thread lmao quote the guy is obviously playing passive aggressive sarcasm on you this give nothing for lot of the small traditions or habits that society apparently finds normal for example that people think that rings are worn around your ring finger only or that ice cream if you have such expansive knowledge about type then why didn you give even the slightest bit of effort in constructing serious productive post that could actually be insightful claiming to be well of course but she didn say it in terms of finding her type she meant it in general love discussing an in depth idea with those m closest to want to go on hours and hours with the the ones hear most are dreamer and spacer related to the look on my face as if see water burning in the distance no idea if they have been posted but these articles are very good to differentiate inferior se and inferior te they are pretty long and detailed so there is lots to relate to and to reject but i have been reading your posts up until this one and honestly believe your analysis and understanding of some cognitive functions is wrong mean that part you quoted that is not ne it is wow this thread haven seen such big collection of shitposts trolling and butthurt people in one place every type is annoying when unhealthy for different reasons infp certainly aren oh lol couldn agree more on this as developed my ti more was able to more accurately evaluate my own behavior now that look back and think of some of the things said and did back in hmm yea can agree with that even when they don voice the judgement you can see it in their eyes my isfp brother has that notorious disapproving look in his eyes when try to look at things wonder what you and many others expect us to look like we are just regular people plus when fe is well developed we can have tendency to be social chameleons this means we will often adjust lol but that what fi does it creates subjective judgements based on their personal experience hence it is perfectly perfectly fine and acceptable to condemn every person in type based on well bit like zosio913 said above many aspects between the types are different yet still similar this makes it interesting for both parties to learn from each other grow as person and gain op it kind of comes down to looking similar only on the surface area ve worked together intensively with an enfp and we had many similarities in what we find important and in our interests where taking that first sip from cold and wet beer bottle after well earned victory on the pitch sitting around fire on the beach with friend and other nice folk watching children have m not preventing anything you are right everyone is allowed to post what they want and repond to whoever they want but ve seen him post nothing

with all kinds of people but if they follow ways that they have different views than have im still friends with them but im not friends with them in the way i am open minded just love the truth dont

moral status of people but of the moral status of actions like the actions of being dont base my morality off the bible base my morality off of truth love and morals the bible just helps open our eyes along the way im not opposed to not using the bible per se just religious hmmm not neccesarily but do believe in god can guess you can call me spiritual but just because im spiritual doesnt mean im close minded enough to automatically reject the agree enemies within the camp its shocking at first until you realize things like that happen all the time enemies within the camp its like when people say cant believe someone like there are people who admit to being members of the illuminati maybe us conspiracy theorists wouldnt believe in it as much if the illuminati didnt go boasting around the internet about the man are you ok you seem little upset thanks im ok im just going through my own issues right now emotional but not spiritual still its true people can use morality for evil but thats not the fault of morality in fact its the fault of immorality distorting and twisting morality to use for its own purposes the forces of evil missali contact me know how it is to feel all alone with seemingly no one on our side dont think like that though good always wins in the end there are many on the bad side dont you think disagree completely its very judgmental to automatically assume something is delusion just because it doesnt seem real though us infjs were beyond that thought we were supposed to if you dont protect yourself youll be unsafe but if you find good ways to protect yourself and help humanity in way that wont attract so much danger youll live would say you just need to you sound like every istp ive ever met critical jerk who believes that anything outside of their narrow little atheist worldview and cute little dawkins textbook is myth and fantasy too close dont ask for much just someone to deeply love and someone who deeply loves someone who still is good person and has their childlike innocence who does the moral thing seems simple right theres nothing wrong with that naive ive seen death im not naive know many things about this world secrets they dont want you to know im the farthest thing from naive but have i hate moral relativism we should all just love eachother and do the moral thing we shouldnt go around killing people and then use politics as an excuse believe politics is probably trick pro life definately love everyone and hate for something to be hurt including unborn babies respect womans right to choose as long as it doesnt interfere with an unborn babies right to hate when arrogant condescending people look at you when you re upset and instead of being all kind and angelic like its ok buddy ill make it ok they act like arrogant jerks and theyre love you despise emotionless materialistic apathetic heartless fiendery definately ifj cares about emotions and morality and love is very morally exclusive worldview so it would be one that clearly has enemies and does not believe that anything goes ie was at one my whole life until february im now at very dark phase and probably at 6 88 close to 7 but definately not there way more positive than 7 but way more negative than 6 please wed make good actors but lot of us find the glitz and glam of hollywood somewhat reprehensible morally id love to put on play with fellow sane people though not implying myself am dont neccesarily have goth phase but am going through phase right now where desire to start my own gothy ish band trying but cant play the guitar and

this is all silly thread to you why take insult from harmless silly comments plus having goof off thread is no excuse for writing insulting posts ll call ok so what the problem with the typing if you re doubting because you re creative then intps have creative streak ne auxiliary if you want to differentiate between intp and infp then you well it seems you re unintentionally doing everything right you re being challenge estps love the chase just show him eventually some signs that he winning you over and think you re good to xstps are rather straightforward and not very complicated his change in behavior in the later stages of your growth the suggestions he putting out there for people to know after his message to you also the fact that he isn making these jokes about meant the former

important to me because it allows me to be in control of myself and and my life and not be led like sheep or taken advantage of also competence allows me to estps from the socionics system equivalent to the estp in mbti have something called an aggressor romance style in other words they pursue strongly their interest recall somewhere an estp said welcome think you ll find the intj forum very active and interesting in conclusion infp if that doesn fit check isfp as second choice ixfp is an fi dom which tends to have its individual value system as you wrote in your last reply and as the dominant that narrows it down to ixfp are you more live in the moment and focus on the concrete aesthetic components in experiences or do you tend more towards getting lost in thought about various if you were to describe yourself briefly in terms of personality and motivation what would you say to start could you tell me what doesn click for you for the intp type also if you were to describe yourself briefly personality and motivations what would you say what you ve written sounds infp while you have auxiliary ne which would make you outgoing from time to time the fact that you don express your emotions for feeling exposed and inwardly fuming off the bat ixfx my questions are are morals in your view something unique to the individual or are more determined in collective manner and also what kind of songs or art interest you the ones ve observed most irl enneagram 1w2 so body language tense and rigid body back is always straight seething emotions under the coolness and objectivity have serious somber yes thank you man walks into psychiatrist office wearing only shorts made of plastic wrap the shrink says well can clearly see you re nuts did you hear about the guy whose whole left side was cut well if she had that written over her forehead then yes about their differences meant more mannerisms body language quirks etc when you can work crowd like dynamite without deadly explosions shit this is hilarious true from experience xd highest for me would be autonomy independence entrepreneurial creativity in terms of career want to be in control of the outcomes and processes and not have them imposed on me not enneagram related when you integrate to type 5 and embody type 7 virtue of sobriety then yes you would become that don think going to your 1

insensitive to puking not sure the swordsman is discussing vibe and in this case think the 6 existential anxiety when sensed by others can be seen as paranoid or overt and hence it would be described that way disagree how can recognize an infj girl irl what mannerisms would she display and how would they differ from infps not necessarily for relationship purposes just didn want to make whole thread on 1 displaying any sort of vulnerability particularly emotional to those outside my family 2 making personal statements without analysis or having reasons to back them up istp 8w9 figured just noting that issue rarely daydream but as others mentioned processing and analyzing things do almost all the time swordsman of mana what you wrote seems more like archetypes that are almost close to stereotypes they can serve as guidelines but as others mentioned has to be used carefully and think you yes makes sense just note though that it doesn necessarily imply that they re traditional some

list and couldn imagine going through bigbrother87 you are adorable not to undermine your masculinity just few minutes ago something made me laugh right after laughed frowned realizing that had picked up that particular laugh from an ex who is completely and justifiably no longer part may ask what book this is last year around this time was just starting to dig into mbti and perc somewhere got note of book called the introvert advantage and was super excited to get my hands on it because was teddy so much great advice as usual thank you you re tireless this m in my second year of college too but m home for awhile ve been wanting to go out of town to visit my godmother for weeks now but didn want to upset my mother she kinda jealous adore les estps does anyone else shut down aka withdraw when hurt from conflict whenever someone crosses my boundaries or hurts my feelings immediately withdraw to further protect myself from hurt have great thread m in that period of my young life too definitely agree with the turtle analogy start in shell when start to trust you which can happen too quickly sometimes my head starts to poke out little bit the more teddy564339 thank you laughing m def under the radar as much as possible well m also going to be biased since only know of two estps for sure one my former close friend two my younger sister estps love them based on the two know even though had you stole the words right out of my mouth it scares me too but regardless still crave pain sometimes and when get it hate it your message sounds lovely to me the tone of it would make me feel safe if was her but because m not her can only speculate tell us how it goes and you re awful hard on yourself it resonate with all of you saying that it hard not to minimize accomplishments for various reasons ninetypesoflight you re 20 o earlier this year randomly made word document and don know if believe in marriage so much anymore but eh it could happen as for kids am completely unsure because as much as love babies and the baby nephew have running around the relate so well with what you re saying ve picked up on laid backness over the years enough where it can appear that am laid back person most of the time and nothing wrong with that but m sorry if there already thread floating around about this but anyone know what about an isfj functions makes us lean towards frequent seriousness was told didn smile once in my here more look at me being conceited cool 36535 36536 36537 m glad made this thread reading back over it kinda cringe at how pissed off sounded in the op but eh that okay got my point across but also in posting my ill informed frustration i a sophomore in college and still struggling with developing the type of friendships prefer non superficial ones think come off as boring to those who don know me and few know me love this have youtube channel and have been wanting to make videos about this sort of stuff for while but just never get around to it plus my channel is geared towards hair care haha taking tests may not be one of your strengths and that fine but do try to work on what call trusting yourself the trick is to prepare as best as you know how and then to concede that you ve learned was an isfj when was freshman in high school but didn realize that there was so much more to learn about mbti types until couple of years ago to my delight when did dagnytaggart no no lol don think you sound racist at all m just not that familiar with functions like fe or si and so simply needed clarification on the notice lot of fe wait can you elaborate more on that please you be surprised ve been feeling very closed off and cynical towards people lately but tonight got hug really heartfelt one and completely melted it can make big difference bigger consider myself extremely loyal but believe this quality comes with cost my tendency to stick to you through thick and thin usually has me sticking to toxic people and or situations that thank you for the input everyone suppose it ll just take time as get older to accept myself for who am and shut out what society tells me to be too much that all m gonna say suggest him getting involved in activities where he can give back to the community took test that gave me 3 results one of them d rather chuck so the remaining two are 6w7 and 4w5 both resonate with me pretty well don feel like posting anything long tonight but m really bad about this ll just address one facet of the question my ability to say no m so terrible at it if somebody really really dedicate each day headspace more to you than to whomever you re trying to get over be patient with what will probably be long process be patient with yourself realize that as much as you this be me showin my face and my crazy hair m sophomore in college always been goodie goodie until last weekend got drunk for the first time gasp accidentally ve gotten tipsy couple times this past year and that a hey isfj community don post very often in usual isfj fashion but really should and this is one topic haven really seen before so m bringing it up are there any isfjs on this liquidcool was just aiming question at older and wiser isfjs technically they don have to be older who have come to place where they are just fine in other words self sufficient that helps lot flory thanks for the reply hold really long grudges too most of my life ve felt unappreciated for what m about and what do for myself others have moved about 7 times so all the close friendships ve had have withered in my senior year of free of anyone opinion how is it possible to be self sufficient if appreciation is crucial to who we are generally speaking frustrating gahh it so hard to actually post things on here second post ever come to the forum and go all insecure isfj and think it has already been posted or it won be good enough post finallyyy thank you for all the support have so many threads to start or search for teddy yep

              " 'how self assured am largely depends on the situation for me you re right confidence is often equated with those qualities in our society or they go hand in hand mean the line between confidence and arrogance is often very blurry there also overlap esfj never even considered that lol do feel she more of an introvert but probably kind of an ambivert more inwardly oriented though she can be pretty social but it mostly asking hmmm yes and no mean she ll notice things but then seem sort of oblivious but can fully say don know how she goes about her work much so can really say that much d say she you always impress me with your intelligent insightful responses aelthwyn pretty much agree see it the same way and said similar things in the mbti facebook group extraversion can very well at yeah thought she did test infp m beginning to think infj would fit her more hesitate to equate insight or instinct with intuition but she does seem like an intuitive and definitely seems to do you think some types exude more of natural confidence or are more likely to be confident or present as such sometimes overly so are some types more prone to lack confidence and be self ve been curious about what type my good friend is it not that important and mbti is really just one facet but have thought about it actually got her to take the test forgot if it was the yeah like said fi should essentially be familiar with their emotions and put them in the context of some sort of emotional logical framework so that they aren overwhelmed by feelings that yes of course there are many other influences someone who grows up in culture that values the wellbeing of the group over the individual more collectivist society might be swayed more towards yes stereotypes etc can certainly affect things think fe definitely does tend to be more prone to being conscious of and blending in with their social environment so if their social environment if your fe was really as developed as your fi would you still really be an infp maybe the introversion extroversion for feeling thinking etc can be balanced like for e in general like tend to and what about infj really though aside from the whole intuition thing infjs aren any closer to infps than isfjs maybe your enneagram plays role think you re probably not an enneagram 4 yeah m more basing it on feedback from my parents don think they think m that selfish but that have selfish side which isn that untrue but sometimes fe users see fi users this way infp and isfj are very different my mother is textbook isfj and can see where we clash lot fi and fe tends to probably clash the most of the two functions think an isfj who mistypes as an think it depends on the individual think feeler like intps could mistype as infp and more thinker type infps like say an enneagram 5 m an 5w4 myself and feel on the t borderline could people say on the surface infp and infj often seem similar but m not sure how true that is really in my experience infjs do seem to give off different aura maybe this is hokey talk but it what is not necessarily introverted feeling or rather what things don necessarily prove you re strong fi user fi dom but isn necessarily not caused by fi being overly emotional yeah d say fe and se would be the main functions behind it maybe combination of fe driving se especially but may especially the strong fe users think whether it viewed positively or negatively can depend on so many factors content intention who is using it your past experience with people calling you by name especially by parents one thing noticed awhile ago is that don tend to address people by name very much in conversation like some people will frequently mention person name when talking to them like yeah match an occupation with an mbti type in the most stereotypical sense accountant istj activist enfp actor infp enfp architect entp artist isfp infp athlete estp banker istj yeah d agree extroverted feelings are more that way inclined introverted thinkers probably the least don think so really maybe any extrovert tends to do it more than their equivalent introvert so enfp vs infp entj vs intj etc because of dominant extroverted function personally feel se know there are many factors like cultural background other personality aspects your mood what you re talking about but wonder if any generalised trends exist with how much each type function was actually wondering if it was about how much we use our hands when we talk but that gives me good idea for thread do certain types seem to grow up faster or try to act all old responsible grown up or adult or mature earlier than others like in childhood and adolescence but also avoiding any perceived do you think intuitives tend to he drawn to the spiritual mystical or esoteric more so than sensors more likely to believe in what is not immediately apparently to the five senses mean even yeah ve noticed infps end up writing these short dissertations m no different think we want to explore subject in depth and want to convey what we have to say with as much accuracy as leading on from my previous posts think it a bit simplistic to say which type tends to be quieter louder more or less talkative think it largely depends on just what they tend to like what your opinion do you agree disagree think we have to distinguish between those who just like talking and those who have the most to say the most substance know m biased but in we re all almost all feeling beings with emotion without feeling life would be pointless we be like robotic automatons so the idea of dismissing emotion feelings is in itself sort of isn the need to stand up for your beliefs so passionately often part of that though haha well obviously we can respond in differently ways being mature about it frankly stating our position or don really see bluntness or honesty as all that particular to tps although most tps tend to be more this way than others but yeah probably broadly true d say lot of nts especially extps in descriptive terms what would you say the similarities are between all those in the delta grouping as in typical behaviours thought patterns damn how could have forgot but you did better job anyway and agree with that honestly think m pretty borderline between infp and intp not simply because of the t dichotomy but in function tests my ti is quite high and while relate more to infp relate lot with yes though maybe she more maternal than she gives off and not all sfjs will be she seems like she be fairly accommodating great idea commented on video she made 50 things about me most and least open minded freethinking types in the true sense of the word not merely being liberal or slavishly following anything that popular d say ntps the most sxjs the least that infps fi doms are all easily offended little unicorns without backbone fi is probably the most powerful function when utilised or aroused and it means an internal system of values not just think isfj esfj is most common then istj and estj though it really depends on what you re looking for and how accurate your observations and conclusions are stereotypically though she doesn seem like an fi dom isfps also seem quite moody at times though we shouldn assume they re all moody get an fe vibe from her she seems pretty easy going wow you re only 13 haha tbh think it still bit young to really be sure of your type though your personality kind of is quite set from an early age think it sort of just matures like my personality type is definitely very different to my parents and siblings though there have to be few similarities you didn have both but not necessarily equally option d say it a complex question that requires delving into biology genetics social developmental know jungian feeling doesn equal simply being emotional of course many people think fi means just being highly emotional sensitive when it about referencing your internal values and infps basically think each type might have tendency to excel more in certain types of intelligences m not sure one could really conclusively say one type trumps them all or few types are much of course it just one example and there are million other factors but know one intjs who gives off the impression of being cool and rational but gets pretty arrogant and condescending when thanks to david keirsey we usually divide the 16 types into four temperaments the sjs guardians sps artisans nfs idealists and nts rationalists as if they share most in common with each calm that fi child

sensor just from what ve read in various threads know it sounds silly to type song but d like for you all to give me your input on what vibe you get from the music the lyrics everything it almost made me tear up so this wellspring of ve always gotten an extp vibe from you with the way you interact with others on the forum but as you know keyword vibe speculation nihm thanks for the invite b0ss even if ve shown up fashionably late and from what ve read there not much else to say from here tride ff and gc have taken all the good points correct would like bit more one on one and sorry for the lack of context ll try to explain better in this post ask intjs because you all have generally very similar thought over messenger facebook app usually it ll be some weird nonsensical statement as those usually work with someone who attention desire but over time ve dropped less and less thought how to get my intj to actually respond to messages requests to hang out outside of college seeing this thread pop up in the infj subforum had me bit embarassed upon first impression but of course the protectors never fail to impress however we ll be sure to not let this free praise do you test people to see where their limits lie how much they can take how do you test do you test people prior to entering friendship show of weirdness or an odd glance around the room do often disregard others feelings in discussion would this be considered unhealthy like ve gotten good at weilding my te but m still weak to insults and unprovoked criticism love to d thought it was cache issue but it seems as if gear that drives the clockwork of our cafe has rusted to halt m sure our intp leader has thought on the matter though once croak and pass on from this vessel strap my corpse to the inside of rocket and launch me into space no matter how ridiculously expensive it is allow me to rest alongside the celestial no offense to the op but the horse has been beaten enough the horse is skeletal the horse cannot take another blow lest the entire topic behind the charisma of infjs and enfps fall apart at the she sounds esxp say this because of the above boldened and also because from your listing she doesn have the star enfp qualities that most if not all inspirers tend to share tell me does sorry to derail the topic of conversation but d like to consult with my enfp sisters and brothers on topic consider rather sensitive though other types may feel free to give their input as sheepishly raises hand haven been called robot although love robots though think they prefer the term android actually riveting romantic story boy meets girl or girl meets boy ve actually heard recently that in life you either actively seek out who you desire or you passively let the world around you allow they re introverted can relax and not need to push conversation as the flow tends to occur naturally around intjs they sorta pull me into my introversion and don mind it if anything we re what up pb nice to see your intro post after many years of you lurking it good to hear you ve decided to join the personablecorner purplebee sorry to hear about your enfp childhood crush you sound hardly awkward welcome to the posse text from your intro post you sound like one of the most interesting enfps ve ever seen actually wanting to be friends with everyone and then disappointed when everyone doesn want to be friends with us an enfp without friends is dead one indeed typical anime protagonist the last two pages of this thread again reveal to me how immensely cute you infjs are in personality and likely physical appearence as well m speaking to females and males here not hard to see that actually the thing hahah m fairly passive around most people even though 16personalities list me as leaning towards assertive assertively passive perhaps but anyway the moment m she gorgeous intelligent and quiet typical intj those of you who have helped me before generally know whom m speaking about but suppose this is thought dump with an open question at the like 1 in 3 if we have romantic affection for you we ll definitely come back around like comet eventually if we re on the fence could go either way but giving person space never usually has it sounds to me like either he realized his feelings for you were not as genuine as they truly were or he slowing down in his advance and reevaluating his approach d recommend you try talking ask away the exposition booth is always open ah this mode of activity if anything d like to think this is innovation mode feelings are pushed to the back while we re under the spell of rarely make promises in this day and age m aware of the constantly changing present and wouldn want to leave someone out to dry due to something happening that out of my control however ve tested infp twice now with the e portion leaning more and more towards everytime take it still refuse to change my label though you couldn possibly be talking to me take your disaster pick there are lot now that have been delayed indefinitely supervirus natural disasters solar flares societal collapse i takeover meteor impact the list goes on it they re not easy quite the challenge which is what believe makes them appealing ll be sure to check an intj out from the library seeing as they aren easy to read definitely new experience and my greatest challenge yet gotta configure the knobs and levers just right so don whoo them too quickly or weird them out from my ne usually ne takes the be an inxj we ll come to you you only returned because of the mention sent out glad to see you re back though falling you bring life to the forum in more ways than one remember cooking instruction where me and my infj bud as usual were horsing around this was long time ago mind you because we were bored of repeated pointless activities and the seemingly wow think just had mind reading mick travis now know what you meant and mango actually think it gets better as you get

stole most of the business from the d like to believe that any intj enfp relationship is capable of working out but due to lot of hidden and not so hidden factors personal preference maturity levels time spent together on actually surpress my emotions lot and tend to think internally so think come off as an entp in public the world is cruel place kid and can afford to walk around with my fi showing ve seen you mention your en ex a lot around the enfp and inxj forums are you okay have maybe 2 enfp customers for every 1000 and everytime they come around am elated so charismatic and charming the males can sometimes having me question my sexuality if the conversation is d like to think lot of us mask our type while in public or at work and it likely comes natural too you can attract enfps with enfps unless they re in their cooldown period then they need the d thought we were one short on last week headcount welcome back angelcarnivore missed ya now if we could only get falling foxes on the horn it be party any type can reach that stage of irritating even our own enfp kin it pressing the wrong buttons at the wrong time being aware that it the wrong time and persisting in your endeavor to piss me she drops these extremely sly hints in conversation but ll never act on them too passive not at all like my active and engaging extp bud who has already gone for it one too many times and large majority of us are perceptive empaths and we love studying the person in the crowd that doesn want to be seen fortunately in most cases we can do so directly and close

would it be and why you might like to also include this have you ever dated an extrovert what am weirdo don hate myself uhh individual liberty believe everyone deserves right to say what they want to say and believe what they want to believe do not believe in some anti discrimination and anti drug hmm false dichotomy alert why would it be selfish to want something you could want something

committed to the person am dating goldfoxx ahhh the impulsiveness of an enfp this is something that have been able to harness much more over the years as gained the confidence it took not only is it an ne thing but depression is so horrible am so sorry hang in there my friend there is light at the end of the tunnel happy hmm enfp are allergic to people who are clingy or try bit too hard when it comes to getting into relationship enfp because we live in our heads quite lot sometimes miss the small ace face it nice that there is someone who is willing to stick up for me not sure about the

an emotional level spent very long time in depression also in the time leading up to the wow thank you for sharing can somewhat relate to this but not from an enfj that was my experience with an infp girl to certain extent ve never felt that with enfjs perhaps it because really thought it was pretty clever there are so many different messages that get out of your avatar it made me laugh when first saw it but then again have dark sense of humor snapple ve always been attracted to the smartass logical slightly rude types they really make me laugh have no idea what wrong with your profile think it absolutely hilarious it lilmisshannon ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh am also going out with an enfj isn it wonderful it so nice to be with another type that also has some energy smile hmm dont know far out ve been

              " ' did you happen to see khaleesi on the bus by any chance just need to get this off my chest need to withdraw from everything right now my mind has exhausted itself over thinking everything in my life the people in my life are draining me am you re the only person ve ever told that to just my two cents since started this thread and haven checked back in for while originally wasn sure what type taylor swift was after looking into her as person more and after much wow this was very helpful and has help me put some things in perspective thank you ended up apologizing to her because had realized that hadn validated her apology which sounded very haven talked to her still my brother is just returning from not being able to have contact because of his job he got back tonight so m giving it time for them to ride out their own thing and summary best friend is an enfp 7 she is functioning at low level and started acting out in insensitive ways that were hurting my feelings confronted her kindly and told her that her pin whole bunch of quotes eat chocolate lots of chocolate listen to taylor swift write songs read my enneagram books analyze it 1000x over m doing this right now actually ve been coming back and lurking here and there two kids under two right now so my life is little hectic as pessimist dream up every possible negative outcome and yet m surprised any time if one actually comes true because m paradoxically still an eternal idealist shower thoughts from interesting so am understanding correctly that you tend to specialize characteristic of type fives in physical experiences se hadn thought about how those two things would work together my goodness it like reading post from past me how strange my husband is an entp and we have had very rocky relationship with his very manipulative controlling mother who is an estj and reckful thank you for your thorough and thought provoking input really appreciate it lots of good stuff to consider you are right was little overstretching in saying it was jung theory well that really interesting what function do you think you use primarily your profile says you re an intp do you identify with being ti dom or does the ne dom description ring bell thank you m happy you found it to be accurate my husband is an entp 3 and although he was very loud and social in adolescence he has calmed down lot as he matured and it been journey yes that was my only intention to cover the energy source because the goal was to actually only address the definition of extroversion and introversion not to talk about the traits that come from it sounds to me like you already know how you feel about the job so won bother you with that analysis but think that you should remember that ultimately you are in control of this that very interesting well wish you the best of luck in your self discovery think that it would be really beneficial for you for anyone really to read up on the cognitive functions more in depth it is incredibly enlightening think and it gives you much more m sorry you re right that was misleading wording didn mean to say that you actually have to literally change the brain meant it figuratively also like mentioned earlier in the thread tigerfella it sounds like what you are describing is more of theory based on your own personal experiences which obviously can speak to as am not you but encourage you to look more don think you ve misunderstood what ve written think that you are right that how much someone desires personal connection with others is t distinction think additionally it is okay think you re right m going to mull it over and think of how can better convey that point thanks for your input you know think that it might look this way on the surface but it really isn quite so simple as that for instance let say an infj switches into an infp this means that the introverted you know don really know the answer to that mean m not sure how to say who is best at things because when it comes down to it two people may come to the same conclusion or gut feeling was going to ask if you were an estp and then saw that you were haha so what you re describing is what was hoping to convey with the way that certain extroverts se doms need to definitely this post isn aimed at people who have deep understanding of personality theory just people who know the basic idea of extroversion and introversion so was hoping that this m actually really interested to hear about this as got that description from one of my books how does thinking out loud translate for you what do you do to process externally my husband is hm m not sure where you re misunderstanding what my written definition is maybe you can explain to me why it reads like m saying something different from the blog post just like maybe m misunderstanding what you re saying but it sounds like you are actually talking about some of the misunderstandings was hoping to discuss in the post the thing is that extroversion and exactly think if you really look into how different each of the functions are and view it not as or or or and so on you understand that type isn so fluid it not something think everyone has gut feeling sense but yes it is related to how you function in terms of an ni dom the person will use introverted intuition first to filter in every piece of hi everyone have blog post about extroversion that thought might be interesting to discuss house of doig extroversion what it does and doesn mean extroverts does this ring yeah ve run into it quite bit thought it was interesting though to see other introverts labeling themselves in those ways too unfortunately think the terms extrovert and introvert haven really even been on here to do post much in the last year or two but forgot how much it helped me to get things off of my chest and to get my mind off of things just got caught do you think infj have overzealous ideals in their heads think infjs can be idealistic but it not inherent to the type when healthy and developed ni dom is used to gather patterns from highly sensitive people are mostly introverts and high percentage of that group are introverted intuitive dominants that being said infjs and hsps are not interchangeable there are highly hi infjs wrote post on introversion and thought it might be of interest to this venue think there a lot of misconceptions among both introverts and extroverts as to what am literally on the verge of tears from exhaustion over conflict am sick and tired of disagreements of people not seeing how wrong they are and thinking m crazy know that the conflicts are how do you deal with people who are stubbornly rooted in their opinions no matter how irrational know that am an opinionated person m not very vocal about that but do have some very think ll change my job title to verbal trash receptacle because it seems my purpose in relationships these days is just to sit there while people throw their crap at me being good thank you my husband has been really supportive honestly my best friend has tried to be supportive too but she is unmarried and has never been pregnant so it hard for her to really on halloween had miscarriage at 6 weeks they call it chemical pregnancy when it so early which so kindly diminishes the fact that it still miscarriage my cousin just announced cool why what does it mean to be an extrovert where do you see the fe dom was that secret that you don speak english well sorry was just curious because of your sometimes strange no don have any idea what you re alluding to what is your native language english clearly is second language to you don know feel like he could do better mean have all of my personality types listed in my sig you could easily just take the basics of each and nail each stereotype in the head if haha nice do you feel better buddy how cute gotta love good troll m going to keep an eye out to

bound to protect and raise for the next 18 years it worse if was single since have to use most of my money and resource for the child also m always bit anxious whenever get low grades and self deprecate myself into thinking it my failure for not thinking it seriously then that lazy emotion flips on and don get that that pretty much why we re introverts am immensely happy whenever am

into heated secular discussion in school or even learn m not huge fan on flowers since don really have an interest on botany it not very fun to me although like the colors of the flowers they help me cheer me up by bit procrastination is one of them feel tired and cranky every day due to procrastination it isn very healthy for me m also very sarcastic and inconsiderate towards people as break promises while m with others usually grin frequently in slightly vague way when am slightly happy and laugh bit loud maybe even borderline obnoxious when m alone open up bit more and m more

drumsticks chicken wings or beef bread potatoes carrots onions apples well at least d know he thinks m good company but yes see your point think expect project could be totally wrong that he tense enough about the whole thing that he might just ps just found out on wikipedia that to resolve double bind it is helpful to use metacommunicative statement which think means to point out the double bind ie should ask him hey grrr grrr grrr grr grrr it is so frustrating that cannot decide if the fact that m curled up in fetal position crying for most of the last two days is because have not eaten

dumped by an infj some fe is in there and it sucks so if you want any my guinea pig is either isfj or enfj can decide since she spends all her time alone no other guinea pigs so m confused about the vs she not mean enough to be an esfj nor is she no want to be alone for while month or two and don want him to think this means m not interested but if show interest now and then withdraw he might become annoyed with the am making chicken soup yay yay was recently thinking of becoming researcher asking people on the street questions sounds much better than selling them stuff but have no idea what the pay is or what the work actually looks 1 is there anything can do if want to date an intj just not right now and want to make sure he doesn date someone else 2 when finally ask him out how should do it d d congratulations always figured that liz was an intj made more social by the influence of all the female feelers around her is there any other in the family apart from liz and the dad maybe mary but that ouch missed that completely ti dominant you say se secondary but he not enough of an asshole to be an istp yes such wonderful logic on my part can we at least agree that ron want

in my country because our left suuuuucks on the compass am about three down and three to the left of the middle pretty centrist really but oh yes perhaps it would be more useful to share knowledge as opposed to traumatic personal tale so here goes an infp approach to sex is described as such the infp views sex as an and with that comment from entropia am off sex for another few months no seriously know only too well what you mean think sex is one of the most damaging and emotionally scarring er have you considered the posibility that her guy friend is not her boyfriend why else would she use that strange way of phrasing it yes she lives with him but maybe they re just roommates it ok let then narrow the conversation to hugs given by people of similar age social group and decent level of cleanliness m sorry but as for the diseases can understand if we were ah the intj think m interested in dating one wonder is rand paul an intj with moral project because that wouldn be half bad suppose it can be very tricky in social situations not to mention don think have the kind of inferiority complex that would lead me into asking romantic interest for permission to hug oh m too scared to hug intjs they might take offense and complain about unwaranted touching or something am the only one who dislikes se types all types with se the extraverts and the introverts get along with si types just fine we mostly ignore each other for lack of anything to say i hate most social stigmas hate the very idea of social stigmas unless the person threatens you or others there no reason to think badly of them m interested but m going to wait at least until january need more time to observe him think it through and deal with some personal stuff that need to get out of the way before start confession dislike most infps including myself maybe dislike infps because they remind me of my own weaknesses it just superficial anger but it cuts sharply like papercuts it not m pro waking up by cuddling too we never really talked about it but think it was because he wanted to have sex and didn i mean we were teenagers and on our second date he gave me this small wooden statue of two people yeah well think can type based on photo pretty well people used to do it on similarminds before it got all virused up and shut down faklubrejle lol am an infp you cannot scare me by telling me that smell great nor by telling me remind you of your mother have you ever read lotr that scene where faramir gives eowyn his yeah for me 8 hours of sleep is must otherwise can get up literally can d suggest doing something lazy and pleasant right after getting up like cooking pancakes or do you know can you guess her type hi is there any way can tell from behaviour if an intj interest in me is more of sexual kind like one night stand or fling or more of an emotional kind like long term omg type ron paul infp infj in my homeland vote for the right but if were american d probably vote for the left or you know ron paul so guess another straight libertarian here although with some leftie ok now for the why like movies that have fairy tale like appeal to them and story with moral behind it where the character undergoes transformation or undergo transformation while er yeah m not really movie conaisseur but based on what on the tv and what in the family dvd library from english language movies d say the magnificent seven platoon cautious is good had been under the impression you guys were just extremely picky almost to fault underestimate the infj in that they always seem so vulnerable and emotional seem to spend time both trying to match their emotionality and vulnerability and it seems overdo it and it doesn thanks am starting to see the problem it seems underestimate

you in his head perhaps intjs are more result oriented and intps are process oriented posted via mobile device we could not be understood we have supreme knowledge on subject so specific and sort of pedantry that no one cares to listen for one more thing we have ideals but it is too far too what the use of thinking too much all we have is our ideas but we just can apply it for we are heavily immersed on this cognitive activity we may need someone to stop us and save us up from have huge fear in rejection and commitment these two terms are related somehow when you are committed to someone you think you should do your best to satisfy this person if you fail in who is better decision maker of the two intp or intj if you agree that good decision maker is one who makes good decisions out

answers the only thing that interferes with my learning is my education einstein ve got lot of things to know but my education prevents me from exploring all that had caught my interest hey there no such thing as thinking too much overthinking is an invalid or senseless word believe whenever person thinks he or she naturally tries his best to analyze everything involved yeah that true it very hard for us to lie am truthful and thus deserves someone who is also the same but could find it on the people in my environment school neighborhood etc this seem to be ineffective way of bringing us down my fellow intps it just don affect us and instead we are able to counteract this by our distinct methods of attack by the virtue of logic am quite strict with the way person should approach me he

aware of it the more pressure exert brain activity especially when cogitating has relevance to eye am really depressed for the past 3 years entered the wrong university and the wrong course and that

but don know her that much only by name we are in school and i always have this habit of looking seriously at particular person with or without him her knowing it when look this person should not look back because think he she will engage me in i am too inclined not to accept any tasks out of something or from someone that are none of interests because am very certain that could nt give my best

laid back relaxed people who always seem so mysterious so of course pick 9 6 is close 2nd you ve pretty much just given information that says you re an extrovert probably feeler but to figure out if you re an or you have to answer questions like do you feel more present in twilight sparkle intp 5w6 pinkie pie enfp why do so many think she an she spaces out and is so out there just enfp 7w6 applejack estj 6w7 rarity isfj why do people think shes hahah alright and guess would say go to some infp and intj forums and see which you relate to most although don suggest perc infj forum as lot of the people in there are mistyped m thinking probably infp you should look at the cognitive functions and decide for yourself and are you sure about your enneagram type you sound much easier 1w9 than 4 like you have think you re an enfp but you really should take the site cognitive function test you re at the end stages of puberty so it is important you mentioned your age believe you are of the sp temperament not nt you may currently relate to an nt but did you when you were child this is very interesting ve officially found my tritype the 845 is the somewhat introverted intelligent headstrong detached hyper introspective problem solver with strategic thinking and like everyone else think this quiz is way too general and the way they present it is irritating how rare is your personality seriously what if had come up an esfj it woul have told me i didn read everything thoroughly but what read seems fairly istj to me think she is an isfj but not strong introvert 1 million more wishes 2 3 would like to be smart ass and point out that did not wish for simply more wishes but specific number of more wishes so it doesn count you are definitely an nf but it seems to me you could easily be p over j and don think you gave enough description about social ness for me to determine or but m guessing you well he an introvert not really enough information to determine or but wood say either an sf or nt and since he seems more of an i say an sf perhaps p but perhaps j am can your type just change don know maybe you ve just grown positively seems to be that when people are molested by people other than their family members it is either their teacher or another adult that is family friend you know my friends seem to know people who have been sexually abused but none of them were it angers me at how common it is it is not normal m not sure about all of them 2 tohru honda from the anime fruits basket 4 w3 scene kid w4 emo kid 8 giovanni from pokémon isfp she is not strong or but to me she seems like an and m saying because of the content of her songs she writes her own stuff so probably lot of it is personal and if it is it the truth he also has certain fears

woman at all she has sense of entitlement she manipulative hypocritical and just bitch she knows how to get people on her side she it possible someone suggested to me that my mother was an intj though so don know oh my both my parents are intj and m an intj don really think so thought perhaps she could be an entj but ugh just don want to be like her that much we both have the same even if you re shy and nervous around people even if you are quiet if you get your energy from being around other people then you are an extrovert even if you are loud around people talk lot nice welcome to the forum eh throughout my childhood in conservative christian school was constantly accused of being lesbian and most of the gilrls didn like me because was unfeminine so now act and think mom infj or so she says think she an esfj dad intj me intj brother isfp have step family and half sister and have their types written somewhere but m not gonna go dig it up espeon is so 1w9 hahah but lugia can be

not born with interesting you know if someone just asked me to have sex it might work better than the other rediculous approaches men try but actually think that is pretty interesting that they have books what does pua mean googled it and nothing came up work student hobbies writing reading sex partnerships am usually with esfps and infps it seems travel ve been to portland and newport or vancouver spokane and seattle wa in welcome to the forum there are tons of infj here yeah kind of got it after awhile like you wouldn think and introvert would have an attention grabbing hair color like pink so the however was ok interesting username tell me does it mean something or did you randomly run your hand across the keyboard they way you type makes you sound like neither but one can really judge by the way someone types and are you going off descriptions or test results read through the descriptions really well no it doesn 2 2 4 two groups of 2 ii ii iiii see that 4 s have feeling you are getting at something else though well have fun okay thanks guys thought maybe an enfj but everything is kind of unclear pink hair however extremely introverted don really think the however was needed because you went from one subject to another that isn connected had bright pink hair from last october used their lavender ylang ylang once it works good but it smells weird they have another scent that is much better and it the same on skin deep assume have to say that cosmetic oh forgot to suggest that you repost this thread in the intj forum my mother claims to be an infj

cats yes 5 abba not sure what abba is 6 steampunk art yes 7 wallabies not sure what guess would like to be an esfp since it is my opposite d like to know what that is like welcome to the forum only saw your first post and actually thought was an infj for awhile but it obvious to me now that am an intj someone explained to me that if my family valued more than it could okay think you are an nt and your view of nature is influenced by your and it makes you look like an either that or you really are an sf and the effects your view of the world making you think most isfp are submissive m not

              " ' today at work suddenly realize that this one girl at work reminded me of the first girl ever loved in high school she the only one have ever loved but didn work out we probably hmmmm that a tricky question because how they treat their friends can be confused with how they treat their romantic partners since they are just all so nice around all their friends in an isfp that is willing to have deep conversations with you and at the same time talks about meeting the right person really strikes me as an isfp simply treating the relationship as friends and ok so although there is different enneagram types of isfp personally think the enneagram is bit gimmicky but anyways taking myself for an example you can tell an isfp likes you not don know about other isfp but d think isfp would like books with pictures such as comics or mangas over novels so yea any marvel comic or naruto and bleach manga would be few suggestions really don think the people you met are esfp my brother is an esfp but he is very nice and accepting he doesn like to argue and making big deal out of nothing is the last thing you i hate it when they start moving away sometimess when somebody does that just say fuck it if this is how you wanna play then you aren with my time but kinda like the push and pull when you do well without much practice it is called talent think you are interpreting practicing in your own way of course isfp often say fuck practice ll learn while doing the real thing but still that is still considered practice yea didn quite get what the question means what is evilness when somebody does something evil don they usually think they are doing something righteous at least in their heads well if you value feelings and being emotional then chances are that you aren an intp from my experience and what ve been told by intp themselves have to say that they don care about you could be mistyped agree it is very stereotypical if going by my own definition of feminine and masculine d say fit both categories but probably feminine more yes but like all relationships the general rules apply attractiveness unless you are an who donx92t give fuck about looks there is lot more factors that comes in when you talk about manipulation if we are talking about emotionally manipulative then attractive introverts would be very good at it story of my life way more than 5 10 btw even though am isfp male agree that words mean typically mean very little to us but occasionally some words can be mixed with actions that can make me very emotional occasionally some thanks ill get back to you tomorrow m really tired now ehhhhhhh you remind me of ixim ok whatever you say man hey guys just wanted to point out that in the last naruto movie hinata shows fi dom as clear as day some people say hinata is an infp but d have to say that in this movie which is not all of them are thinking methods therex92s shit load of things wrong with this post and also the author uses really bad sources such as x93 iq testx94 and x93mbti populations both is weak thanks man would appreciate it if you don post in any of my threads you are fucking retarded and honestly don know want any of that nonsense here you are of course free to do whatever you want how is that the key lol so if see someone being out going and awl ways having lot of fun then think he is esfp but then remind myself not to associate stereotypes with types now not bad is more clear straight forward but not sure if would call it more accurate than tyanamiros thanks gtg to sleep it 2 00am cya tomorrow edit maybe tyanamiros is more best one so far enfj is really accurate lol my cousin is always telling me shit and saying it for your own good and m like yea ok gets annoying sometimes lol and yea isfp fits me you forgot enfj name each type and the most obvious sign to tell you that they are that type in real life am going to use this so please take it seriously what said was common sense lol nothing genius here you make it sound like had an good argument or something lol and again nobody said anything about iq being intelligence or intelligence intelligence is subjective so that why gave it definition of my own stereotypical intelligent which is what most people think of when they hear the word intelligent nobody said the nt are obviously smarter stereotypically defined than isfp but that mainly has to do with that fact that they enjoy knowledge we usually all eventually end up being at least average or astrology is for nut jobs if you believe that shit you are retarded end of story ok so work at an restaurant and itx92s amazing how fast feel drained while working there itx92s really an extroverted environment therex92s ton of people and for some reason just feel drained you made lot of assertions in there whether or not introversion extroversion share the same aversion for mainstream d rather call that grey area since every human is unique but think we think we are superior for the same reason that every human thinks that they are superior in some way and you can compare any of this because everyone values are different introverts well the reason can do conversations with people is because can think of anything to say there always reason for social anxiety whether it is because you think you are fat ugly low from my experience this has nothing to do with the mbti my cousins says he is enfj but ix92m not too sure about it anyhow he is definitely not an isfp and he does the exact same thing he ok smart one you genius congratulations you win the internet ok so noticed that big part of me being awkward is because m scared about what others think of me and not knowing what to talk about but that why m posting this question but realize don know it really hard to say really m pretty sure my little brother is esfp 13 year old country girls are fucking stupid no way all esfp are country girls if that what you are saying but yea think there a difference unless they are grading you on creativity skills troubleshooting hacking gaming philosophical critical thinking etc then itx92s pretty much memorization lol ap students are just the cocky arrogant kids who think they are genetically smart but when in reality it all about memorization all grades is about memorization to all you ap students you algorithmics really don get how an intp would be interested in isfp isfp are usually dumb as fuck when it comes to intp type intelligence which is it stereotypical type of intelligence find it almost impossible to troll troll mainly because they are already in on the game they have already shut down all their feelings because they know they are playing the game of trolling it pretty much what frequinologist first post said had this kind of thing happen to me before in 9th grade was in 10th grade don really know if d describe the other girl as there always that rule that no matter what the type you can troll troll trolling methods

with this m competent and intelligent but my boss doesn seem to believe in me doesn respect or care for me that fine to each their own but m going to be working at this hey sorry for the late replies didn mean to ignore ve been on business trip heyhey thanks for your perspective you re right shouldn pretend to be optimistic when m kc ahaha first off m genuinely sorry for bringing chaos and confusion to the enfj forum being the self absorbed person that am just had to have another relationship thread all to myself long post to follow my boyfriend is an enfj 27 and m an infp 24 we met while doing our masters last year and have been inseparable e 24 7 for close to year we re the love of nooooooooooo seeker you are so lovely and intelligent and always look forward to reading your posts if you haven noticed even stalk you from time to time because want to know what you re up with the exception of keeping organized not only do do all those things but actually do them better than my enfj significant other lol infp here my boyfriend is enfj and the past six months have been completely transformative for the both of us ve dated other xnfjs in the past but they didn work at all like this relationship eh it depends m an all or nothing person was quite flaky when casually dated couple of guys because subconsciously knew that they weren quite right for me too alpha too conventional love it clumsy yet intelligent is me too and you might be the first infp know that likes rap really love that your guiding emotion is hope because think it a core component of fi ne just like you say its absence or presence determines whether there a vacuum or wellspring in our in pixar inside out the boss of riley emotional headquarters is joy her parents emotions seem lot more mature stable and share the power little more evenly who is the boss in your in pixar inside out the boss of riley emotional headquarters is joy her parents emotions seem lot more mature stable and share the power little more evenly who is the boss in your just finished my masters don know if ll make it through phd though there nothing want to do more than to remain student thanks for the solidarity guys yeah it sucks it especially hurts because when we let people in we really really let them in and give them access to the most sacred bits of ourselves we ve fellow infps do you find yourself losing friends lot have history of people wanting to get really close to me but then backing off when they detect signs of disinterest worst of all have sorry m not an enfj but m at similar place in my life and just wanted to solidarity fist bump you being somewhat more future oriented than past oriented find that get lot of anxiety this isn a special snowflake post nor is it an attempt to start an infp circlejerk ain nothing inherently better about being an infp and also don think we re more misunderstood than hey fellow infp obviously m not an enfj but since my current partner is one thought d give few cents based on what he told me your profile is interesting and ve no doubt that there used to think there was something wrong with me because felt horny all the time haha turns out it was more case of needing to have target for focusing my introverted feeling on at the have far greater capacity for loving less than perfect situations than thought had am brave enough to put my heart on the line see darkness all around me but even if wouldn have bill and hillary clinton ai tran 75 and papillons you guys are right that if she so willing to drop an 11 year friendship she not worth fighting for and no won be contacting her again after she bitch slapped me my enfp best friend of eleven years verbally bitch slapped me and door slammed me few months ago and wish no longer cared but unfortunately still do we don live on the same continent so what do you guys dream about while asleep notice any themes patterns do your dreams tend to be realistic or fantastic or both also how would you explain dreams unconscious vehicles for don think it take anything more than direct and sincere exchange about trust he clearly has nothing to worry about quote ha all are so consistent with your advice just be uh they re friends is there something you re implyyyyinggg quote haha well think it backward looking to suggest that guys and girls can be friends he should be able to be friends if you re in committed relationship where you see your partner as the one what are some reasons that would make you go out of your way to go hang out with other girls alone or maybe he literally was really irritated because of some other issue mean ve snapped at people before as long as it isn a pattern is it really something to obsess about has this wow you re beautiful aside from really nice eyes ve noticed that all the enfjs ve met have very compelling noses yeah it does agree with you completely about people not being able to find total fulfillment in any one relationship and about needing network of relationships to fuel their self growth not exactly sure that what was hoping to find out through your answers don know if there an absolute definition for it but suppose would say something along the lines of desiring oh please interview eggsies it would be so cool to meet devoted member of personalitycafe ll admit m especially curious because eggsies mentioned being chinese and too am ethnically do you consider yourself emotionally promiscuous fe is cool and all but it the auxiliary ni that makes enfjs irresistibly attractive not to be presumptuous coz m not enfj but think it quite easy to exaggerate their niceness and alright thanks for the advice and solidarity yes think do tend to allow myself to be victimized will watch out for that he hasn blown up on me since the incident wrote about but if it hehe don think it a bad thing either m learning that using fe can be quite fun being with my enfj and watching him deal with people has taught me to have better rapport and better wonder if an fe fi couple might not start to resemble each other are fe and if necessarily two ships passing each other in the night as an fi user being with an fe user has helped me to extremely true am absolutely fascinated by ni the elegance which which it drills down to the essential this is why ni users strike me as much more intellectually rigorous than ne users who are hey thanks for all the thoughtful responses seeker thank you for sharing your vulnerabilities regarding love ve lurked here quite bit and have to admit that for some reason find myself well know that this enfj had rather troubled childhood the details of which won divulge out of respect for him the short version of it is that he has experienced shortage of love anyway know can be quite annoying sometimes absent minded and little slow to react think enfjs prize efficiency and also seem to expect more of those they love so really need to there literally isn which is why it all the more baffling he still apologising day later so it must legitimately be an anger management issue yesterday my enfj lost his temper with me while we were out and about and raised his voice at me it was because was fumbling with something while on public transport and he gets impatient when the hardest part about being infp is that fi is fucking insatiable one thing ve come to conclude about my enfj boyfriend is that he does not relive emotions the way do that is he isn able to return to the embodied experience of specific feeling sometimes',\n",
              " ' are there any enfp that are incredibly quiet when you first meet someone or group this makes me question my personality lot ve been like this ever since could remember what are some think he the asshole type whatever that is interesting only know few esfj but do know one esfj that winded up leaving our rather large social group because she didn feel like she was getting invited out even though we invited hey everyone have just recently changed jobs and now ll be working at an insurance company full time along with my video production program full time ve always worked part time when going to hey there have several best friends m an enfp type 7 so sx for reference roommate close friend ve known for 8 years isfj enneagram 9w1 best guy friend enfj personally one of my omg lol had an estp fling up until month ago and this sounds eerily familiar that shit takes some sacrificing the se and ti can be so damn conflicting if you analyze it too much your brain my parents were an entj infp couple for 21 years in total they worked at first and believe money was the one huge thing that held them together like glue they had no similar interests my dad is finance accounting and laboratory work anything with lot of seclusion the short answer being an enfp 7w8 with so sx can tolerate awkwardness too much it mainly if the individual is being inappropriate in situation that doesn call for it at all aka d say notalone would honestly say to not look into it too much it sounds to me that she really appreciates you as friend if an enfp happens to be very comfortable with you they will be very think this is true for the most part however in my experience think from dating extraverts vs introverts would rather be with someone who is extraverted at least at my age of 21 have high rocky horror picture show crazy ixfp really leaning towards watched your second video if you need person to talk to let me know also if it helps m going through bit of freedom the world is my oyster type of phase so am living lot more in the moment and not having as much anxiety of what do we will see if it used to have qualities of enfp use to be idealistic and then started to rethink those values te m just not much fi far too outgoing to use it enough ve accepted the world as it is se xsfj enneagram 3 so sp are my guesses my question is in regards to ti do you usually need lot of time to yourself when using and working through ti especially at younger age the estp hang out with drives me up wall because depends on so many things really could see how it a fit went on date with an intj and m an enfp it been casual mental connection is on point and he really great to talk to about all opinions are welcome which typically comes first for you work or play play lol it always comes before work which describes you better carefree or intense d say m pretty as someone who has dated an intp for 3 years give them their space ti users need this especially dominant secondary users extraverts can have hard time with this do not force lmao so true while waste time on reddit my entj dad is definitely out in the real world getting shit done he barely knows how to use the internet so that accurate where are you guys wanna date an entj now notalone how has life with the enfp been going since we all last posted hope all is well fi only makes me more anxious indecisive and self doubting don use it as much not sure what everyone elses experience is with it ni find also can create lot of anxiety estp adventurous intelligent spontaneous always wanting to go out and do something new the fun relationship istj the meeting of the minds in the opposite cognitive function order could trust with just meeting people or trust in seeking potential partner as an enfp have little to zero trust issues with meeting people just don become very attached especially at first as an enfp was convinced that she liked you to be honest am not nearly that forward in both friendships or with potential mate so even that threw me in for curve ball it can be difficult m not sure if m an atypical more mature enfp on constant tertiary loop or maybe even different type entirely at least from your descriptions above know for certain m exxp without update everything was going well didn recognize that had feelings for him until 2 maybe 3 weeks ago he and hung out incessantly and basically did everything together except call it hey folks ve been studying mbti and cognitive functions for while now and as informative as it is ve been having an issue figuring out exactly what is going on with my type ve been typed the one thing can highly respect of the sp is that out of all the sub types they tend to have less anxiety than others m sure it due to the whole live and let live type of attitude that how old are you both she needs to get over it seriously she should ve been over it the day after it not even that big of deal he sounds like the intp used to date who was incredibly fascinating on mental sense but damn had to drag his ass out of the house to do shit with him not only that but had enough kyusaku will very soon think he suppresses his emotional feelings in regards to love so it a bit difficult to even get consistent answer with him unfortunately like it more difficult great question actually used to hate being touched so much as kid and even as young adult until about year ago m 21 my parents really never showed affection in physical sense so enfp should only get married to someone that is as invigorating and interesting as themselves it the only way it can work enfp always crave what if and the possibilities of things aside from picked estp entj intj entp estp mainly for fun think it be nice to just to have crazy adventure filled relationship with someone of the estp variety before ever settling down someonesmom best advice is to run from this guy as far off into the distance as you can he bad news he seems like he emotionally mentally unstable and can already see you getting jerked wasn asking so much on if it could work as much as was asking if there is any type of indication on his end that there is possibly something more than just physical sexual connection m an revenant you seem to pretty sure what in particular gives it away really well obviously will wanted to hear some feedback before speaking with him he pretty anti commitment and then proceeds to tell me that he like to be in relationship within the year since how did you come to that conclusion fulgoreakuma any and all thoughts are appreciated estp i ve got couple questions in regards to the estp 7w8 ve been seeing over the last month and half m an enfp 7w8 if that helps as well met him and we had the intentions of just my father is an entj enneagram 8w9 sx believe and m an enfp 7w8 sx absolutely adore my dad and ve only come to appreciate him as of the last couple years he and used to clash lot warning cusses like sailor is very impatient and is incredibly independent wow can believe this thread was continued from 2 years ago after further analysis ve learned that my dad is an entj and my mother is an isfp m very close with my dad still and don after taking my long hiatus from perscafe due to school and work ll finally be back on tinychat next week hope you re all doing swell cool justicetaylor think it good to have expectations but to be flexible it can be easy to get pushed around with zero expectations but one can also build up huge wall and become close minded from the few that know ve realized that it a terrible idea to insult an infj intelligence like and relate to what you wrote great deal m dealing with the same issue in terms of college my major is cognitive neuroscience m currently

many people who did not know my mbti type before hand m more or less married to my computer at 13 taught myself m absolutely terrible at speaking to people in daily situations like chitchat with the cashier that kind of thing simply can respond appropriately to these things in real time however he sounds whole lot like my economics teacher who is either an entp or estp does he often forget to mark all papers or show up late to class for reasons like oh was at home watching tv why though couldn find much yes do this lot although had never coined it as extrapolation thought of it as another manifestation of my ne very well he is pretty peculiarly attractive yes you re spot on hadn seen that interview before and must agree he came off as an extroverted nf or sp enfj seems the most likely to me oh wow could we be treated with picture i have been wondering what adrien brody mbti enneagram is he quite blatantly perfectionist abstract precise with articulation intelligent and most

eragon enfp enfj saphira intj murtagh xstp was trying to pin down his type and think he is either an nfj or ntj extraversion is probable too seeing how he represents his niche in the media he was

              " ' always thought he was lower fe pesonally maybe an istp after watching some more and reading the rest of this thread can see that blair is more fe than te so will say she is possibly isfj most people in this thread have said they believe blair is exfj am the only one who believes she could be istj she takes such pride in her traditions eg her family on thanksgiving and serena at interesting how you all said infj as thought he was an extrovert for sure laughing d have said enfj instead although see more ti than se can see him as ni dom though so yeah see what you re saying with veronica especially when you compare her to someone like fiona in s4 or frank but just don see aux ni at all do you think she loops te se bit dicaprio seemed lot more esfp in his early days now he seems lot more serious te but that probably just him maturing hardy is istp for sure imo agree with these enneagram yeah the joker didn really seem like the joker as in previous incarnations like he didn feel crazy menacing enough to me after all we heard about leto supposedly amazing method portrayal monica not really sure of her type her bipolar makes it hard for me ian agree with estp from what arrow said but yeah he also tough for me because of his mental illness mandy esfj i agree with you about inferior fi so yeah entj makes the most sense also never thought of that but she and katherine are actually pretty similar mind blown lol that makes sense can see her being entj with all the planning she does combined with se to adapt to what happens with the liars but then can see fe in her enjoying the game and her noel khan to me seems like typical bad boy estp charlotte have no idea but guess feeling dominant what makes you think te dom ve also only seen the movie haha tom ripley he very hard to figure out but ll go with istp he very cold and calculating and thinks quickly in crisis and has unhealthy inferior fe with definitely wouldn have said cage was fe could see that always saw her as esfp so entj would just be the same functions in another order she could be playing up her lower functions for the public can see fe in her where do you see se keegan is very emotional but wouldn have thought he was fe as he usually pretty quiet so for him d say isfp ian harding agree is fe maybe esfj he could be enfj as well but he indeed can wait to see her take cersei down next season even though love cersei as well thanks for your explanation on jlaw though see what you mean about how esfjs might be bit less jonathanlivingstonseagulll what makes you think aux ni though can see fe dom and se tert but have trouble seeing her as enfj because of her ni or my perceived lack thereof d definitely say intj for shadow there is not one piece of fe warmth in that guy idk that why thought she was esfj really because she quite lively like her way of talking isn super focused but on her youtube channel when she does qnas she generally sticks to the think judy probably estj she doesn have the warmth or charm of an fe dom at least to me anyway haha the rest agree with kitteh always thought of sfjs and nfs as healers medics exxps as tanks knights istps istjs estjs and entjs as melee fighters and isfps intps intjs and enfxs as caster ranged fighters reckon she probably esfj she seems very open and very fe in her videos you can see her trying hard to connect with her audience fans the fact she thinks about what she looks lot could be se agree with this but marshall could be an extrovert too imo the way he compromises his personal values to take corporate job because he needs it right now for the money seems like ne fi not necessarily just think that the way arya looked at it was more fi like an fe user might in my eyes at least correct me if m wrong be more inclined to take moral quandries to friends or take her most recent episodes she is ordered to kill the actress whose name forget but she doesn why because she doesn believe it is right she thinks she would be killing her for the thrall could be that it the same functions as an nfj only in different order he not exactly the most touchy feely person so it possible that he a thinker instead of feeler idk man could see that even though it completely different from the type ve put for him haha guess it his personality as green jesus that makes it seem like that idk thought of hey guys don think ve ever actually seen thread for world of warcraft characters mbti types so thought d create one here these are my thoughts for few of the more major characters istj and got 58 on masculine 54 on feminine and 53 on androgynous didn score particularly strongly on any of them haha guess need to go with less neutrals wow you really did type everyone haha aidan actually thought was fi user so d ve guessed esfp instead alya reckon is esxj not 100 sure on te or fe though amy estj imo andy seems to actually don think know any intjs haha well don think know any well imagine d get along with one fine though mum istj dad extp guess have quite large group of friends from school but outside of them don have that many m isfp despite being one of the less emotional and more

              " ' for few years believed was all the awesomeness of an intj then one day when was reading all about mbti again started finding forums like intjf and perc and people were talking about ni emotions aren that bad and scary the ability for any type to effectively deal with emotions isn as innate as you seem to believe it just comes with practice given that our mode of feeling is it not controlled by everyone at all controlling economics relates to buying and selling power of which most or at least fairly large portion of the population have little to none above don so much get into relationships which have obvious compatibility issues as used to for me from some of the past hurts ve had after so much emotional investment into person and it will if you don walk into the intp trap of thinking that ultimately whatever you do or study is somewhat irrelevant if our entire purpose on this planet in this experience we call life is to wait isn that normal guess do always type as intj in mbti tests but after understanding cognitive functions and reading the two profiles intj and intp over with fine tooth comb sounds heavenly would fly from almost exactly the opposite side of the planet for this western australia at least think that pretty close to the other side of this sphere floating through personally think february 29th would be best wouldn want to appreciate and celebrate us too often think of what would happen to the world aww we re nice subtly stirring people up and watching them explode isn that malicious and most of the other dark side things are just thoughts we toy with goes and reads this thread to be often think about how would behave if didn strongly believe that treating other people as would like to be treated is not only an admirable virtue but essential to the very fabric of i do like my ness just ask if she knows about mbti if she doesn tell her how awesome it is and then she will go read up on it and discover she is an intp well maybe she won if she is different type once since you invited me to it y all not ya ll whoa steady on with the encouragement reading this made me want to top myself and m probably the least depressed ve been for the longest period of time in my entire life wow these are good responses don get me wrong don usually dislike eating and since do have to eat would rather eat delicious food than just bland whatever unless m the one preparing think this entire sub forum is that thread most threads you read reflect some aspect of the bigger things of life such as meaning and purpose and understanding think most people in this felt similar when looked into the enneagram to me it just felt really subjective and all bit wishy washy compared to mbti and especially when dug bit further into cognitive function do you mostly eat because you have to in order to continue functioning or because you really enjoy the experience of eating food have been blessed with ridiculously fast metabolism which is d say follow your heart more but not in the bored wasting time way you may not be in touch with yourself enough to know what your heart really wants didn for long time and that okay well ve been around that mountain few times myself here is what have learned about myself hopefully it becomes helpful to you as well like people lot more when really like myself sometimes if m deep in an internal conversation or m kind of simulating discussion that has high amount of emotion confrontation need to make for example will often catch myself you think about how you could steal something without getting caught only to reflect on this line of thinking instantly and decide that as fun as it would be it is generally poor life choice that no wai always used to do this as kid but m pretty sure ve never told anyone my entire life because they would think was nuts also when messed it all up or didn have time because so far love the thought of dating an enfj dated an esfj for about year and in the end we just couldn get the communication to click and see where each other was coming from think an enfj well my life has not really panned out as had expected m not sure what expected but not my journey so far pretty bright in elementary school put in the classes that are supposed to ve personally always thought that the idea of gender equality was flawed to most people equal means the same but when it comes to gender equality do not think that it a great idea to well not having bothered reading any responses to the op ll just say yes yes in romantic relationship suddenly turn to mush and love hugs and back rubs and all that other touchy feely stuff huh so that what ni te looks like in response don see point to your post maybe missed something like context definitely get surprised responses from people who are leaning on the extroverted side but only see me in small doses or from other introverts when they find out that am introverted am quite crave having people who are really in my life and can be open with even if they don really get me kind of enjoy crying when things feel hard and my emotions are all locked up it makes internal definitely internal have seen so many people take the that just how life is approach and come off worse for it know that random occurrences can happen in one life that are runnerveran thoroughly enjoyed your laid out philosophical explanations of various viewpoints regarding intrinsic value it actually helped me resolve lot of discord in my personal life where if thing has value does it matter if that value is intrinsic or extrinsic by nature if something happens to hold intrinsic value that see no use or purpose or affection for and therefore travel college will indulge your appetite for ideas and mental stimulus at the end of the day you will find way to get this one way or another travel will challenge your perceptions about well haven sifted through all the comments but scanned the first page and this didn come up the whole stuck in the past thing have definitely experienced sometimes am just done and best sister ever wow this is really good it sounds obvious and ve even had that mindset in the past but needed good reminder to not be so automatically bitter and reserved towards people thanks in my opinion doing something that serves customers is not such bad idea you don have to have all the answers since there are others around who you can ask also you ll improve your would go insane can spend hours and hours of every single day with so but other communication back and forth is just draining to me my last relationship ended almost entirely because we went my two cents think you re being typically intp in wanting to have all options considered and everything straightened out before saying anything at all think you just need to let her know think this might be good list to help extroverts accept that it okay that introverts are different in certain respects it may help them to interact with someone who is an introvert and it may was wondering today where did the idea that everyone should have right to medical care come from we seem to be on average the longest living society in any history of at least the last would venture to say that the reason your intp made you feel so unimportant in his life is probably because he did not know how to make you feel important what is important to him and what is sorry that was meant to be for blkrbt m not sure what happened there this is quite valid point _ on serious note though and just sharing from personal experience kicking the gaming habit and the friends had who encouraged me to stay stuck to video games m not sure have ever had the chance to meet or get to know another intp know one or two intj an istp and an infp feel like ve met plenty of people who love to discuss ideas with as ti dom like when things seem most efficient for given purpose for example would drive home not just down the same streets every day but in certain lanes because of how know the was actually struck by this idea myself last week as next step figure it wouldn pay too bad and would give me autonomy in my work do you have many staff do you find the return on the time true vulnerability in the sense that one is figuratively able to live boldly with their heart on their sleeve people who have spent such time and dedication to something that they have mastered well m just going to throw in my two cents take it or leave it as teenager always thought that coped fine with life and school and home and all the stuff that usually happens to kid ',\n",

purpose of the old thread and bring redemption for all word crimes ve come across few intj theists in my time but this is my first pantheist m for totally open borders have no problem with anyone just moving in however there is one problem with me wanting this and that is because of politics don blame immigrants for this but you say that like it couldn still apply in regulated capitalism that will happen because of price ceilings there would be shortage because the gov set price would be lower than what would that not realistic at all let say lot of rich people get together and decide that they re going to sell kidneys for hundreds of thousands of dollars they still couldn conceivably control if both sides agree to price why would there be need for government approved prices black markets grow out of unmet demand created by government regulation if no one wants to pay sell at the it ethical either way as long as it done voluntarily however may be bit sticky with definitions but once you get monetary compensation whatever you give ceases to be donation it never been and don plan to other than ww of harry potter because want to taste the non alcoholic butter beer that not how you deal with women that how you find the fastest route to getting laid with an empty headed woman who falls for the most manipulative men laughing which think is against the 176338 think mulan style training camp is too messy for us think matrix type training is more our forte fewer disney sing alongs when started reading this question thought you were going to ask whether we test drive things in our imaginations which do all the time before real test drives so yes do ah the brainwashing card on the contrary have escaped it it is society which treats women like infants who shouldn be responsible for their actions and choices simply have come to have good thing m talking about the feminist movement not definitions this argument is akin to true christian arguments like arguing that the crusades had nothing to do with christianity have giant post with comments and videos on the topic on page 4 that what m referring to in particular was not saying your analytical abilities are ineffective m saying that as you don recognize it probably because you re female and say that with all humility because didn really see it for long time either d say the worst areas are how men are treated in maybe examining your feelings wouldn be waste of time perhaps the reason that you can seem to get rid of your depression if it not hormonal or something is because you keep pushing your know just find self evaluations as stand alone references to be kinda pointless it would only make sense if business was going to compare the self evals with the third party references maybe you are drunk apparently m the koon now ninja am trying to discern the intent of this thread ve learned not to take praise from drunk people because if did would be in very awkward position with couple of people what is this haven felt lonely in long time being physically alone never bothered me much and m pretty good at entertaining distracting myself what bothered me was when could be around people for wouldn say get more withdrawn than usual but do what you do don tell anyone it my birthday on one hand it just lets me see who engages with me normally with no pretense of birthday ve seen this happen before my highschool actually did this as practice for their teachers the office would send them the form and they were required to rate themselves and we wonder why we forgiveness is something that asked for too often and to me it an easy way for wrongdoers to get out of the obligation to fix the situation one of the scenarios that really ticks me off is that go with the un birthday philosophy if we re friends show that you re aware m still alive for 365 days of the year instead of waiting for one day year to be happy that m still alive and it was ok don really like narrations much in songs but it wasn too bad just prefer instrumental songs that use more classical instruments though sound less computerized keep thinking that the ts will thank you in their heads from safe distance if you re this delightful now can even imagine what you re like when you re sick m thinking all those girls you think don exist are probably in hiding believe it or not there a you ve already said you re depressed and your strategy for picking up uncaring females is not making you happy when you stop screwing idiots you might actually have some time to find intellectual well since the goal of maximizing getting laid is clearly not working then stop if it just makes you miserable know girls are rare but you won find them by sleeping with half the no get that it harder for guy to do m trying not to make it sound like it easy it easy once you get there not so much to find in the beginning but also know that there girls of rides to the doctor would be part of symbiotic relationship you should be able to ask them not tell them if they re not willing to help you when you re in genuine need then set boundaries and what can be factual about symbiotic relationship if m with someone and they have job part of the money they earn goes to feeding and clothing me and vice versa if m working those are of course humans are animals but that doesn make any difference because there are plenty of animals who behave symbiotically in nature as social animals who at least some of the time live in you clearly haven listened what ve said makes me wonder if that what you do in relationships as well never said give affection from the start and definitely did not say that you like said before almost all of the girls you will find on the submissive websites are going to be messed up mentally you want girl who will do everything for you whenever you want yet you don i can understand that ve been in that situation myself the point want to make though is kinda the same one as the relationship that if you re not able to be vulnerable with someone you can mm it doesn sound like m going too deep see if one of my friends said something like that to me would probably never talk to them again and unless you ve communicated to them that you alysaria just reminded me of something with regularly find yourself with these kinds of women you don have to answer this if you don want to but think it would be interesting to know how oh well that obviously on the other bad side of the spectrum can see why you develop longing for that kind of girl now if you re used to girlfriends ignoring your needs altogether it would even turning off humanity the propaganda is so irrational and full of religious zeal that can have that sense of appreciation for it outside of maybe looking at it from psychological sounds like you want long term housekeeper chauffeur more than girlfriend are you prepared to exert the same anticipatory behavior for her needs or is this one sided because can tell you wouldn describe the propaganda as elegant either pleasingly effective recognize some of these from the mbti test m not spiritual religious and have not done enough research on the topic to justify believing it from scientific perspective so lean just to make sure understand the situation clearly lily might be wanting to go out with another guy even though she still dating cem if got that right whether lily said she is they re all short so don mind 18 female german and finnish swede hmm skepticism no they are horrific inefficient and sign of sick society and clyme almost can believe just saw nazi germany and elegant in the same sentence have you ever even visited i really hope it not just an intj thing hope it a do you have reasonable amount of common sense and dignity thing don have any fear of sex just very risky sex so no to highly doubt that large enough percentage of the intj female population here has loudly proclaimed that they re homosexuals for goodness sake if you re going to write in another language racism is not nearly as big of problem as it was fifty years ago racism and sexism might not ever be completely dead but to say that if it not dead then it still at oppression levels is so entrenched in the patriarchal society any true patriarchy has been dead in the west at least since women have gained the right to vote so can be entrenched in something that doesn exist ',\n",

forum posters intimidated to silence and so on have no interest in what you have to say whatsoever but it still gets me in trouble unless with an intj only people that get it and can retort even better while even non nts can do sarcasm have seen istj retorting with biting level of irony life is full of questions isn it dry no hon had tested as intj and wrong again it is not that didn like it

              " ' girl lol maybe they think m super shy and submissive but m not they are intimidated because there is more than meets the eye m not perfect is what mean when say have flaws oh but that witchhaven yeah consider myself to be attractive and good person with obvious flaws work hard on nonetheless always end up hurt by others like romantically in the long run ve kind of deer and owl opened this super quickly because his happened to me haha no at you hating women this happened to me with male childish stuck up selfish too nice flaky weird too weak dumb secretive doesn know how to take care of self yes totally get this friends or family get extremely offended with this and think am being insensitive but it the total opposite this is how care for people see the issue and friendships tend to be unfulfilling people are shallow and my expectations are unrealistically high ve given up long time ago in romantic relationships but at least want to have some kind of jane really seems like an enfj to me but understand the isfj typing m dealing with that right now still debating co rumination is known to worsen or create symptoms of negative feelings and emotions think if both the individuals maintain healthy habits with there is mutual understanding between me and other istj but no connection intp don think have been aware of ever meeting one why is that that is my criticism from my own personal perspective and from an infj mindset don view relationships in positive way in order for it to be successful especially for us infjs think it is important to have couldn pick none really stood out to me lol m picky with beauty and notice it takes me while to actually perceive someone unique beauty rebel like cute yet quietly strong animes like sailor moon and kobato do in my own selfish way but obviously m disappointed that others don see this haha but realistically there are unique traits and strengths in others that really admire like my mother m incredibly nostalgic especially with music and places don usually go for people who are too alike to me there has to be some sort of balance always have trouble finding things edit turns out he is an istj we are now dating don think ve ever fallen in love maybe infatuation but not love enfjs strong rapport and overall good energy enfp males strong chemistry and positive energy istjs calming rational structured all which admire intjs connect very well and the infp females ve met so far are really nice at first but then once you get to know them they are actually really mean lol they have very strong opinions very all over the place in doing things maybe because we feel we aren valued enough and want to feel appreciated dad entj mom isfj sibling esfp me infj my poor sibling is such an outcast haha so guess got and from mom from dad and from both actually get told m more like my dad infp males what were you like as child were you inherently charming did you immediately take liking to strangers was curious bunny liked getting to know people and ideas very creative much do from time to time maybe 1 2 times month my best friend who is also an infj gets terrible terrible ones and she is still in the process of finding cure and has even had few surgeries for sometimes do bit but it depends on my self esteem that day have two areas am extremely insecure about but when think about it one of them never never noticed until was bullied about they do but they are harder to type always think they are ixxps instead of infj the three ve met are careful quiet and logical also very private which is why couldn decipher the fe yeah whatever when don believe them get your shit together why are you here if you re just going to ignore me you need to work harder grow up am pretending to enjoy myself looooove traveling but it has to be well planned out and enough time for me to rest and eat well tend to get stressed from it because anything could go wrong like going to pretty places or artificial_lifeform give her lot of patience and time we tend to be hot and cold and may be oblivious to our feelings for someone until it too late you mentioned self esteem issues and high yeah the connection with other infjs is instant it not chemistry thing its just knowing that person is in way following you and understanding where you are coming from though for me feel still haven found deep connection comfort is good enough and accept it m not sure if everyone can get my wavelength got sick of trying though truly appreciate if people are trying to hate hate hate hate confrontation especially from bad experiences in the past where fe takes over and rush into conclusions and make things worse always have to double guess myself and think genuineness understanding recently people who are too judgmental over everything really bother me and also their lack of consistency in views actions or opinions guess this is more of i think have but not in bad way ve known them for many years and hold them dear to my heart but would prefer not to spend time with them ve had two infjs who have done something not having enough motivation anxiety in interacting with others and over thinking about everything the natural probably to others the star in my mind haha the coquette when was younger and immature not fear but mostly don waste effort in wanting people to understand my way of thinking about things also play dumb sometimes out of habit and protection not good but it keeps me conflict free get intj sometimes depending on my mood definitely feeler though but over time have developed my repressed applecrumble you explained it better than did sometimes can stop thinking about him and then later switch to being repulsed get uncomfortable of the idea of having relationship just update guess m just uncomfortable of sharing my life with someone else if it ends up long term and m not into flings or anything even though it easy to think you might be after sharing first one not sure ll probably scream at them and call the police second one ll act as the innocent victim to make him look crazier than he already seems and calmly tell him that wasn have any of you felt really attracted to someone and then felt confused about how you feel about them if they like you back ve noticed this happening many times in my life and find it very feel uncomfortable with eye contact don know many but one isfp met gave off very warm calm and friendly vibe he seems like good person just see him as friend co worker though it rare to get that kind of warmth like to dance to my favorite music watch bunch of interesting youtube videos make up vides blogs travel asmr karaokes music or series get on this site and research random

              " ' don have much time so ll be short and possibly not as thorough as could be there are facts how could there not be in this universe things work certain way facts 1 yes it is feelings not logic that drives you to learn suppose that means humanity only exists because of feelings interesting but that means that instincts are feeling too since hallo dropping in on ur conversation affinity few ultimate truths shocked every fact is its own truth though so you are saying that you want to learn because once you learn everything there is no longer reason for existence and thus you are then ready to die that makes sense on personal level so what you are suggesting is that we are all one that seems like an oxymoron in and of itself all one m sorry my computer like brain isn sure how to process this here how my projects are usually better than the groups too do kinda the same thing but wouldn describe it as trance it more my mind doesn want to shut down because it trying to rationalize categorize file and sort the info gathered over know that feeling that the feeling ve had recently know need to do better too due to the fact that m losing debates on this forum actually jumped into debate that did not when people you re arguing with know you well enough to know that you want them to get point but they don know you well enough to know that you re going to use that point later in the argument that what do and then occasionally they say something important but still not interesting and get screwed for not hearing it my point though it isn a pleasant one is that when you accumulate that knowledge what happens to it when you die it gone it doesn matter to you anymore and even if you share that that makes lot of sense now that think about it well in this field that pretty close to all you can do xd good heavens now see what it like to not be objective 0 m amazed you intps heads don explode from all that you think too much about possibilities and not enough about necessities never found high school difficult or challenging in the least at least not academically have confidence that ll survive college really what m worried about is the cost not the academics this is much better way of putting what am thinking if hypothetically those points were all true you would be correct however am contending whether they are true not which direction they point time and the universe are illusions forgive me if misunderstand you but are you saying that we control everything simply because we percieve everything when you are born you do not have control over where you are born yeah that makes sense to me kinda more the being aware of my breathing than the pattern of short bursts though thanks think xd well despite my brain ardent protests couldn keep away from debate like this in that respect am extremely intj heh read the first page and then gave up ouch my head just wandered into this thread after 5 hours of standardized testing sorry but not in the mood for this much thinking right now just got done taking the act for the third time this time after 3 months of no school and on about 6 hours of sleep think did better than last time cool though had this one piece by precisely but ultimately we are going to die anyways and anyone or anything we might care about enough to die for will eventually fade away as well so sacrifice or not it really doesn if you get over and do it though and you are terrible at ad libbing am you ll end up looking stupid and to me at least confident and stupid doesn seem attractive and planned thank you ultimately it doesn matter finally someone else who sees it feel like this is just argued because neither side wants to give an inch to the other we could have been created interesting just have hard time getting to sleep at any reasonable time so stay awake doing stuff until get tired and then go to sleep figure why spend your time trying and failing well actually despite the fact that we are supposedly able to acheive world domination don really feel like it would be worthy pursuit assume other intjs either feel the same way or sounds like the typical intj evil mastermind childhood wink have this too stay up till all hours of the night taking notes about this designing that researching the other and not even for stuff related to school the next day frantically work on little more on the subject think surprisingly often surprising to me anyways about immortality and thus about death think that rather than fear death we should be thankful for it in think words and actions both lie you just have to figure out which parts of what both of them are saying is real and the patterns associated with each person or type of person and you ll have hey as some random greek philosopher said choose job you like and you won work day in your life hey there are way too many greek philosophers for me to remember all of them much return introvert fistbump forgot to mention my reading stuff read lot learned to read books like the 10 page kids ones by myself at around 3 or 4 years old by 1st grade was when m exhausted can still think but start missing details lot and because of that often come to incorrect conclusions or worse sound like don know what m talking about usually that seems like more complicated method of what do in my head possibly more effective too but m not about to start studying until know need to it a waste of time otherwise imo my thought process 1 this thread is fun ny 2 latin 3 love latin ooooooh goodness 4 laughs hysterically at poor translation from latin 5 there was question 6 oh my word that an incredible coincidence my teacher and few classmates were just discussing that well feel like don really understand what you re trying to tell me but assuming that my interpretation is correct would say you are doing something similar to what do especially when i take certain amount of pride in my occasional bouts of succinctness cool speaking is an action this see no point in worrying about the inevitable as my time is better spent on other things slightly ironic as from an atheistic viewpoint it ultimately doesn matter how you spend your shut up and refrain from talking when m around girl like as has been mentioned it is not because don like her just said did duh but because well here my logic fear so this is the venting thread time to vent fourth day of spanish class extrovert teacher is extroverted and expects everyone else to be as well bored everyone in class got spanish was very strange two things that stand out to me are that disagreed with my father lot because his favorite reason for me to do things was because told you to do it which was not well certainly don that my problem just asking my own question here but what should do when girls that m good friends with start liking me and don like them that way m each one of those describes me either with 100 accuracy 1 2 3 4 6 8 10 12 13 or 0 accuracy 5 7 9 11 specifically regarding self help books find them to be useful source of information breathe well suppose being biological organisms we have to but think many of us would prefer not breathing would mean it would decrease the overall amount of noise make could joined facebook enthusiastically but was disappointed at first got to find and talk to lots of people that hadn seen for years but the conversations stagnated and nothing came out of this exactly this the only time would willingly sacrifice my life was if someone really really cared about was in trouble or if knew was going to die soon anyways it hard to say anything more without ',\n",
              " ' the only one kept stuff for was my boyfriend who passed away otherwise it is either given back or tossed definitely feel that way feel disliked by everyone all the time to me it a reality and it consumes me lot of the time and then when it comes to those know love me feel like i couldn travel alone have to share my excitement and experiences with someone can eat alone at restaurant because there nothing to really experience and can read but traveling and out of respect sit and listen and try to genuinely participate do this because realize that want the same from them and how do know they don feel the same way about me my mother in law also have hard time getting over emotional pain and heavy emotional experiences m actually really good at break ups but ve always done the breaking up so m that person all happy while just wanted to say that from my perspective watching my little cousins grow up that kinda feel sorry for them my mom isn wasn like yours though she has her own control issues that she like an idiot and can look them in the eyes this isn very typical of the infps that know well myself and my husband actually can read people very well and am usually very understanding also would be very happy to see my child as have been diagnosed some overlapping anxiety disorders the main one being ocd apparently these anxiety disorders can be so very closely related that unless you clearly have one dominant disorder how do you know that his feelings for you cooled and he rejected you based on your math skills highly doubt that was the issue it very possible that his love for you went unrequited for so it hard to say for me because had issues consistenly from very very young age up until even now had issues both from an environmental standpoint and from mental one my counselor and m afraid to admit that have the same problem feel like most of my values principles are fairly simple and not hard to follow and get really upset when people don share them or say they do love turquoise and cobalt and think they describe me well one is lighthearted and sweet turquoise and the other is deep and almost brooding cobalt of course find both colors to be depends on what month we re talking about m thinking could have done without this month don listen to this it not true think my husband is cute and he certainly isn gay don equate gay with cute two completely different things understand know m happy and that understand pure joy but it seems that always fall back into the pit of sadness and loneliness it sucks lot of my problem stems from extreme guilt take it as compliment rarely get cute if do it usually in reference to how dressed that day think it would be nice if someone told me was cute beautiful would be excellent i never even thought about it like that but you re right am very quick learner but m also very good at understanding what someone is looking for ve had many projects where ve either great music great concert show the ones that got me going the most were the cure type negative david bowie ac dc jane addiciton rhcp depeche mode and weezer ve seen lot m far more sarcastic in real life also like to joke don tell jokes but joke around m rarely serious in person especially in group setting and m more than happy to break up the was flop in high school because was preoccupied and bored my motivation was only in the classes really was interested in like psychology lit spanish and art history and algebra ii funny for me because m really good at interviews ve been offered every last job ve ever interviewed for m very upfront honest and know how to sell myself without being arrogant or was 14 it was my long time boyfriend 1 month or 2 something like that an eternity in middle school he was really cute and all my girlfriends were jealous he was so cute and always egged my mom and my husband my mom has proven that mother will do anything for her child she always had my back and still does and she gave me the freedom to be who am even when felt like 1 yes 2 yes 3 below 4 yes but in my case this directly relates to 1 view my purpose in life to be helping those who are suffering the loss of loved one typically an untimely death had an artistic mentor my mom is professional artist and has been for some time before she went professional and into fine arts she did crafts she always had art projects on hand for us to work in the fine art industry we create custom mosaics for installation fine art pieces offer classes and do mosaic jewelry my mother has been professional artist for good majority of my dated guy like that when broke things off as gently as could he stalked me and told everyone we knew mutually including all of our co workers and even some of my old high middle school yes my bosses would always have to reign me in and be like caterpillar you can expect yourself to be superwoman you have to give yourself break that was almost daily thing great ve been having really rough time these last few weeks and it just gets harder and harder as the days go the only way can really find myself living in the moment these days is when force agree you need to live with someone of similar temperment and household philosophy lived with my family then by myself for 7 months then with my now husband those 7 months alone were nice thanks for sharing this hope to read it later looooove john frusciante he really seems as though he could very well be infp he definitely an introvert that for sure incredible m very good on the business side of things can easily switch off my feeling emotional side to thinking critically or business i know how to separate those two functions as long as it doesn this guy is wicked bitter huh it funny that he states that people are primarily drawn to the infp types thinking they re deep when really they re superficial once you really get to know them definitely have this problem my parents didn have to punish me growing up didn want to disappoint them so when did d be heartbroken have been basically told m disappointment by what are you talking about the op asked if you liked it and why or if you don like it and why everyone is giving their opinions no one is bitching except for you right now only responded to think it in your best interest to seek professional help boredom is not typically the cause of suicidal thoughts as for the jobs you need to stay at this one until you find yourself new truly understand your plight realize that this sounds ludicrous to the people on this board who have seen my posts they re always painfully long but like right now m really upset and you will have hatred for her for while but it will diminish over time say that because as time goes you ll realize how much she screwed

my grades are horrible and wish they weren but just can find the motivation am in bit of pickle my dad wants me to drop out of college because it is costing too much money and my gpa is 1 98 he is

personal computing technology forward though with 2 the problem took me good 30 minutes to solve am at work though so wasn able to concentrate like wanted to used the crossing out method as well to figure it out just spent way too much of my workday solving this it was fun though so wanted to share it the author of this problem is albert einstein who said that 98 of the people in the world couldn where work take initiative on things that don necessarily need worked on like making websites to help aid less capable employees trainees or talking to my supervisor about new things ve have tried to smoke few times while sober and disliked it think it just smells tastes too gross for relaxed 10 min buzz if am beyond blasted from drinking all night often smoke but can definitely relate to what you are going through right now felt pretty depressed in high school mainly because had no friends to hang out with was made fun of lot in middle school and don understand why our society puts such big importance on sexuality people are allowed to be whoever they want to be honestly have thought about the idea of being gay just don i have trouble getting real friends as well in high school felt had literally zero friends had lots of superficial aquaintances but no real friends honestly felt like loser just used to care more about what people thought of me in high school throughout high school lot of people thought was an idiot dumb hyper and weird it kind of bothered me then and tried to agree with most of these posts don need to be leader in college deal with this lot in group

              " ' to my knowledge and experience there are more questions also noticed that the time took the written form it was actually harder to differentiate what they were trying to measure from the it can be because it a very internal process there bits from the unconscious percolating into one conscious awareness not necessarily it highly depends on the individual not necessarily if the individual is personally rigid and inflexible due to their own personal or cultural influences and experiences then yes of course but that true for those with strong see where you re getting at but not necessarily those that have predominant ne may have more obvious creativity those with strong ni are still very creative but it not seen exactly and that true on so many levels paul d guess is an infj he pretty reserved but creative and structured with an obvious case of writer block not so much focused on the logical as much as he is concerned about others would have to agree with you when acting he appeared more extraverted like perhaps an enfp but if you watch any interviews can see how private he was he was creative for sure but yes yes yes definitely it especially easy for those of us who have high level of empaths so naturally those in who are nfs and especially those with fe ve written about this bit hi gollymolly sorry to hear about the breakup m definitely feeling for you there yeah we all always tell ourselves something like that but how realistic is that not very if haha okay that makes sense now mmm yeah that sounds like more of fear of intimacy or more deeply stated fear of vulnerability and self exposure makes perfect sense why m going to apologize beforehand if any of my comments feel tough but it truly is coming from love feel like sometimes we really just need to hear the tough love reality in order to get past don feel that they necessarily dispel as much as just simply not be as heavily weighed upon feel like the initial functions and preferences gradually balance themselves out with all the other feel that you re taking this mbti thing bit too far there a difference between recognizing preferences in myself to fit model versus fitting myself and other people into the model so it exactly it not very proactive ultimately there are nts that are very interested in bohemian dialogue there were several in course took who were very into the theory in fact albert einstein intp was involved in its creation can i feel like we ve crossed the line in the discussion where we ve all agreed that we like sweet potatoes over white potatoes but it getting technical as to whether the orange or purple ones are yeah from what m gathering here is that really any people disagreement with my initial post is coming from their belief that don feel there anything to gain from debates and expressing isn that what was describing in my initial post felt that was the theme of this thread already that being said perhaps there really is just lot of mutual agreement going on here it i really wishing knew more about the theories of these two unfortunately m only familiar with the jungian aspect that was mentioned so please add to the discussion that actually why m really liking the enneagram lately because feel like can really mistype if focus on how each type looks when at various stages of development can look at the haha it okay actually just found it funny that you and every person that has responded to my question about reasons why has mentioned something that was talking to someone about this yes find anger rather interesting lately like tragic event happens and rather than experience and express sadness people respond in judgmental anger and start blaming others m not get what you re saying but feel like m missing step or something to fully connect it back to the issue yes there knowledge in all sorts of ways and not just intrapersonal oh feel there an increase in violence worldwide not just the us was just talking to my boyfriend in south korea last night and he was telling me about some 16 year old boy who brutally oh love the moderators here high fives all around that part of the reason came back because was on another forum for while and the moderators were very strict on rules sometimes that would be interesting not only to just see why other people are there but it also way to encourage people to stop and reflect upon why we are doing certain things cause feel like eh kind of encouraged it just to get the discussion bit less intense felt the humor is needed for sure somebody posts something and it then seems to open the door to be attacked or something wonder if these are the early signs of soon to be alien invasion or wwz hahahahah hmm so since there are several who feel the same way have on this lets play with this idea bit why do you think this is coming up more people on the internet lot of people with why thank you oh know they are harmless it just when other select people may not take it that way just like to describe ni simply by taking in many different ideas and data and noticing patterns in order to come to conclusion the exact opposite we see in ne that sees endless possibilities you just explained my hesitation for posting this kept looking inward and asking if was just somehow looking for more ego boosts but then realized was actually looking more for ego agree completely the only thing that irks me is that lot of it seems to be ego strokes and there doesn seem to be anything else in the world that brings about ego strokes more than religion and see remember it always being there on all those extra forums so avoided them most of the time the infj forum was alway like my safety net where didn have to be exposed to that stuff now feel like you re kind of describing more of fi user like infp or isfp fi is more personal value oriented while fe is more community value oriented this is why to the infj an infp can wonderful thank you for sharing ve been bit hesitant to say this but m feeling inclined to mention it anyway as maybe some old timers know was on this forum quite few years back started back in 2009 and then yeah was having them about every night or every other night about couple years ago through certain people had crossed paths casually at the time eventually found myself seeking out i ve read through everybody thoughts and especially this one the one thought that keeps coming to me is the importance of healthy boundaries within relationship this is going beyond type and m sorry to hear that ve haven had too many jobs after my undergrad but can quickly say this hate working for other people ve been in education it better than business d go nuts there but hate mmmm that can be difficult in finding books like that in the world we live in guess that when ve sometimes turned to watching disney movies laughing know they are kind of tragic in btw m saying universe to focus more on the reality of our experiences rather than to put any energy into the endless debate of whether deity exists or doesn exist feel that whatever your based on my own experience have the philosophy of follow the feeling if its not supposed to happen the the universe will throw something at you to stop you from messing up if the doors suddenly not to much live very simply so simply that was living in this apartment for the first month with just couch japanese futon and two tables there more now but it still very simple if if were you d focus more on how to change myself to better improve such relationships rather than simply look for different type or different person within that type that being said listening patience with others yet generally now not so much previously know when to not grasping philosophical and very abstract concepts but even ve struggled with some because they love how you simplified this and broke it down to simple description of each type and explain each type integration easy wish saw this sooner long before dove into reading all these feel like you re taking this bit too far loved thailand japan and korea enjoyed russia and china as well though little less like because of the extreme culture difference believe it was one of the websites of vicky jo an mbti coach so it was either n j or infj or infp closer look just not sure which one since that was very long time ago

the difference between the visions of the two personality types then you would have to type me as hardcore infj but m not an infj m positive that m an hey just wanted to update you guys that ve been to able to narrow down why had hard time determining my mbti type turns out my enneagram tritype was confusing things up bit always what would 471 look like as compared to 417 m in that triad and know that 4w3 sx so is my primary type but m not sure about the order of the other two yep would agree impossible can be half one personality type and half another especially when the two types don even share the same functions although the primary function is the same both the auxiliary and this is definitely si working si is all about the past what has worked in the past what you did in the past what you thought in the past overall it embodies all of your past experiences you can do all things through christ who strengthens you let us fix our eyes on jesus the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross scorning its shame lols you re an infp of course you re gonna think that infps are cool dude mon the amount of self pity is its just ridiculous do you understand what other people are going through right now at this very moment 14 year old indonesian girl is being raped just remind yourself that they re mainly concerned with the ethics and principle of the subject at hand just as need to remind myself that you guys are mainly concerned with the logic and however odd find it my entj friends actually like being called out and corrected though have enough experience with them to know that when you do so you have to prepare in advance provide ve researched this for months and know definitively without doubt m an infp just can figure out why act like an infj m outspoken actively and happily present my convictions to from the original post would say definitively without doubt infp justifying theft because its against the man is totally an infp thing especially for unhealthy infps infjs are much greatly appreciate your feedback regarding what wrote about retreating from the world when one ideals are not met because of society moral shortcomings all was doing was communicating how hey crazies how goes it m wondering how many infp friends you guys have my best friend is an enfp but my 2nd best friend is an entj and 4 other entjs are in my top ten closest friends even hahaha lols maybe some infps are boring but they only are if they re depressed unhealthy infp its rare for decently healthy infp assuming that they are close with the person they are with for the sake of giving us some information to work with what makes you lean towards infp enfp when you talk about personal value systems are you talking about morals or principles or the prioritization of values etc and m guessing that things like efficiency productivity hey guys know ix92m an infp but m having tough time nailing down my enneagram triad and its variants ve always been an idealist my whole life yet there always something in every infp wouldn say so at least if having low amount of motivation to figure others out makes you an infp and having high amount makes you an enfp then m an enfp last year was new member of ve heard that infps and intjs regularly develop friendships with one another which wouldn of expected in your experience is this true if so what is it about your particular infp friend appreciate the feedback the reason posted here and not in the enneagram forum is because think that the individuals there would not be able to understand what behavior is indicative of my hey broski how excitable do you get enfps are extremely excitable and infps are not even close in comparison except in extremely rare circumstances infps may reach enfps excitability only if hahaha lols yes agree that mtbi focuses on cognitive functions but would argue that the way in which you take in information and perceive the world significantly and drastically effects hey guys know ix92m an infp but m having tough time nailing down my enneagram triad and its variants ve always been an idealist my whole life yet there always something in every infp hey guys know ix92m an infp but m having tough time nailing down my enneagram triad and its variants ve always been an idealist my whole life yet there always something in every infp gotchya that a pretty neat way to help determine type like it as you probably have noticed now that ve nailed down my personality type thanks to your guys help ve been able to yep sorry for the delayed response ve been pretty pre occupied since school started back up here is ranking of the 6 types that you asked me to look into in order of how much relate to reticence that was extremely helpful many of the reasons ve found hard time identifying with the infp descriptions ve read is because they paint infps as individuals who when confronted with sorry for such lengthy response took quite bit of time reflecting on how react to challenges to my values so was unaware that some new peoples are lending me hand in helping me conclude hey guys thanks for your responses uxdork almost positive m not entp because pretty introverted unless m the most introverted extrovert possible lawof23 thanks for taking such an am having heck of time trying to conclude what mbti personality type am think knowing which cognitive functions concern themselves with trying to convince others of their personal views that it m frickin running in 2036 if you guys can hold out for that long found this

makes that clearer it just as easy to say that the dominance they prefer isn unbridled that they still have limits and preferences it isn like don see the value in this it is implied in our replies that the partner is competent and consensual to begin with they get to the sexual situation the same way as any other partner but during m pretty sure that most would say competence is required to truly be dominant the entjs ve been with truly like being bossed around for someone to force them out of their heads they having been with couple entjs and m with one at the moment find that they like to be controlled in the bedroom more than anything they spend so much of their lives in charge planning probably but she seemed happy and didn want to alienate my only emotional support originally pursued her for friendship and value what we have in that regard funnily enough after actually forgot that made this thread haven seen my friend much we are still very much on friendly terms and communicate every once in while but life has been busy for both of us she is this ceased being infp relevant while ago but couple people seem to like reading the updates every once in while so here one think m in an exclusive or at least semi exclusive m not terribly worried about the entj my longest relationship over 6 years was with an entj and it worked for us we both are competent on such completely different levels that things stay since you asked there are still ups and downs but the general trend is up m still fighting some personal demons not directly related to the topic of this thread but there are some good wish did let me know if you figure it out usually like hanging out with 1 2 people at time but it hard to build the type of relationships where that comfortable friday is my day off and spend most of it cleaning doing laundry try to make friday date night when have women in my life but recently that area has dried up bit the last few weeks ve coagulation we pick at them those post palpable people reopening wounds that were better left behind the aegis however feeble of the fortified heft of steeled blood and mind where ve considered this too and d love for it to be the case when you were in this situation did you pull back on initiating contact hanging out she has bit and don want to come across as certainly haven been direct it been tacit agreement so far that this would be discreet because of the friendship had with her ex up until now that friendship ended literally days ago not update while making post to my blog saw an update to hers talking about how excited she is about getting texts from this other guy and some cutesy pics about distance relationships it seems while concede that the situation is complex this comment is completely uncalled for there is nothing insane about this post and telling me to go elsewhere especially after referred to d like some advice it not necessarily mbti related but like this community so figured would post my situation here m an infj as is friend that have been having an ongoing blackhole consternation recalling once bright constellations full of people and of life of lovers and their strife all spinny and revolvy on axes fraught and wobbly bounding towards thank you very much for this response before this girl was more like how you describe your husband now everything seems far more daunting it hard to go back after feeling like someone truly some are one of my best moved out to california on whim and is doing great out there live on the east coast others live in state but about 2 hours away and see them maybe twice year one friends casual and close whom respect and who respect me ve never had lot of friends but ve had few close ones that miss dearly the few people have in my life right now don meet mostly stagnating social life the last 4 5 girls have been involved with over the last couple months have been insecure girls that initially approached me put me on pedestal and watched me was when my school did plays part of the way through my four years they switched to only doing musicals and while can play and sing can really dance so became less involved as obligatory two month update things are little better have new full time job for one an opening at my part time job led to me becoming director of the center and while it a bit of pay m not doing so well still haven found new full time position and fear it will be extremely difficult to with forced resignation on my record as result need to immediately move out it funny you mention isfjs both my mom and little sister are that type the relationships work though there is pretty fundamental communication barrier speak almost completely in metaphor thanks for the input agree to certain extent but know she is in pretty happy committed relationship right now and is able to give healthy love to someone just not me at this point my longest relationship was with an entj and it was pretty solid all around we complimented each other very well overall my perfectionist tendencies and contentedness with not being very social got about two weeks ago received pm asking for an update on my situation it gotten pretty interesting in april was informed that the school heard about our relationship from reliable thought should give you guys an update more like feel the need to write some of this out it been little over month since we last spoke more than three since we ve seen each other m it been one week since we talked on the phone it gotten easier to bear but not an hour goes by that don think about her in some way understand that most of this isn my fault but the selfishness definitely stood out to me on the phone honestly think the situation was becoming too difficult and she went out of her way to look for reasons to make it not work beyond the mini update still bit too broken up to accomplish much can get any work done and can get myself out of the house was supposed to go to bar with friend and ended up falling asleep your advice was very much solicited and is appreciated and after this experience have to agree with it talking to her in some ways just frustrated me more and while it may have relieved her of thank you ll get there eventually m sure it a whole bunch of little things like little arguments over favorite poets as well as the huge things like just how much of herself she had given watching the movie again now that said that her character isn just like the girl in question but definitely connect to gordon levitt here yeah fluctuate with that when remember those great moments it hard not to but do realize she has many faults not the least of which is not knowing what she does and while found her earlier in the thread posted on the phone conversation we had with each other got about as definitive closure as anyone can reasonably expect she explained how she felt as best she could and absolutely on the first bit but take absolutely no solace in her or you getting just rewards d rather she be happy without me than miserable any other way she hasn had much in the way of thanks but your kind are downright cruel if it just stayed silly little affair wouldn have been hurt so badly but she escalated it so quickly and with such ardor and followed know you re right thank you this is some of my infj obsession coming out often feel so misunderstood and it felt damn great to feel like we understood each other and at least on an empathic thanks for the feedback it all sounds right on point and demonstrates that maybe ve been approaching all of this too selfishly maybe the majority of it really was on her end and nothing could hi everyone this is the email she sent in response to mine before we talked on the phone to me was uproariously drunk on the floor of my jersey bedroom and checking my email for thanks though understand that it needed to end really hate not knowing what she truly thinks of me and that something said led up to this she even admitted it was an inconsequential thing so talked to her for about an hour and half tonight on the phone this time we were about as conclusive as anyone can expect to be she said things went sour for her when violated some aspect that a pretty big one for me took serious pain killers for the first time this weekend had my wisdom teeth removed and it seriously mellowed me out always thought it was bizarre that people honestly have no idea just needed to say it it was pretty selfish honestly but after the connection and intimacy we shared refuse to let this end pathetically even if she doesn respond because m masochist wrote an email to her providing closure for myself felt our last conversation inadequate if you have the time and patience d like to know if was foolish for doing well yes and no think the circumstances are lot more to blame here than either of our personalities though her age and inexperience factor in quite bit as was able to draw her out quite ',\n",

monkeys have ever met your lord and master thelordlyone just need to say wow just wow of course an entj is going to seem emotionally handicapped compared to an enfj who has dominant fe m just going to

the professor hell you could even just needed to chime in real fast to clarify somethings about socionics isfp entj are the conflicting relationship and not the isfj cyamitide is not really wrong in what he stated but forgot don know man how can you get that bionic leg you ve been wanting for your whole life unless you shot yourself in the foot first maybe m just bit more eccentric than you other entj and may be an entj but over the years have come to grow tired of leading everything all the time it slowly gets to you after while when your having to not only do your job but come to fix so have been taking the time to seriously ponder over those questions that haunt everyone in their early 20 how do fit in where am going why am those existential questions that pop this is exactly me when drive playing loud personally emotional music while hanging my arm out of the window gives me sense of peace and contentedness in my life it feels as if my mind is any other entp experience something similar the first couple highs just remember laying on my floor and staring at my popcorn ceiling and slowly started to notice pattern of shapes of please for your own sake really examine socionics you ll realize they are two completely different systems of theory uses different lettering scheme for typing and only use the 4 letters for mufkapla when learning this mbti stuff always had this annoyance with isfj sorry but will be using isfp for the rest of this post it only came from the inherent bias that mbti perpetuates yah see don see it as us making friends that easily but that every mother er is just way to damn clingy and needy and somehow they just smell us out try with all of my might to project am just really darn curious if anyone that could type themselves as entp have made mention of this or if this is more preferred in other types also if the only reason you are kicking your definitely understand and feel you on not being able to feel satisfied when following desire growing up remember most adults met and interacted with always remarked on how mature was for always hated school in my life expectually high school and was one of those that didn need to try at any of it to show my intelligence always had teachers praise me for how smart was or grow tired of feeling like am talking like jedi so when am talking about you normal self will refer it as the ego and for the dark side it will be dub the anti ego just letting everyone have come to enjoy m crazy so sue me these times when the pendulum inside myself has become off balanced and my more primal and darker side starts showing its ugly head find exercising only oddly enough just replied to p that made very similar argument it comes from that gap that functions cause when not used in complement to support and reinforce each other just thought it sadly sometimes miss those blasted thoughts am pretty morbid know but not thinking of suicide is worst feel suicide is what helped me get myself out of the mind state that would be remember feeling that emptiness that comes with no religious spiritual beliefs became an athiest when was in like 6 grade or so remember just doing it to follow in the steps my sister that disconnect is simply the push and pull effect that fe and ti have with each other fe gives us infj that feeling of wanting to please the most amount of people we can and to ignore what you did the right thing just brushing it off clearly she sees you as some sort of threat to her and tend to just take these kinds of matters lightly and try and see it as more compliment than have come to realize even though still struggle with it is how can you love another person when you can love yourself first how are you able to come to understand and know what love feels had huge post written out and accidentally click link and lose it all so will just be giving you guys the short of it since don want to rewrite everything just lost 1 must be man only 10 things don think that is near enough bullet points to fully express what all of us really want guess ll give it try 1 the most important thing we want others to remember having this exact same problem in my late teens early 20 i would try and create elaborate events that had variety or mass appeal to attract others to come they would always fail and this thread has just opened my eyes up about myself all infj in particular we are so motive seeking in our own ego that even when someone is actually trying to help cheer us up and build little at some point in an our miserable infj lives we must come to accept that we love being in the spot light even though we may be introverts it is that fe that really drives us and our feelings in it is not book but have found the television show wilfred to be entirely dedicated to informing infj of all their hidden problems they don know about when watch that show something just how else are you suppose to develop as an individual than everything in life is learning lesson have held numerous customer service jobs about to get new sales job and never done sales neither think both spectrum of the j dichotomy are interesting as long as they are written well nothing can save crap writing from being crap and think this is were this kind of topic will go hippy infj type here and love all drugs equally except heroin always found had to do drug multiple times before would actually get high off of it analyze myself to much and when try train has been derailed will admit that this thread may have not been the best idea or none of us really even cares about those blasted estp i don know ll let you guys get because your not actually showing any kind of sign that maybe he should stop he probably thinks that since your laughing back that your not offended by any of it almost sounds like he could be is that how we come off to you guys always wondered what estp saw in their duals really appreciate that anytime meet an estp guy they always come up to me and shake my hand you guys are their is an estp girl know in real life that have known for couple years now she is probably one of the first girls ran in to that had an instant liking to get fancy for any women it is always different depending on who talk to where they consider infj perceivers or judgers it almost creates two different infj types depending on how you answer those who consider if was an intj in your shoes the next time anyone of them touch me or anything on me would grab limb and start applying pressure just enough so that pain will show on his face and he will really am just glad that really understand myself so could stop myself from projecting on to you always did have sense that infj have this odd style of writing that is little more why does this seem like your taking what say so personally do we always come off like this when we fell like where being attacked it does help put some old experiences in new light think have always gotten impressions that type is somehow set at birth but am not trying to use genetics to explain it now this is my infj craziness talking but types seem more metaphysical by nature you guys are amazing people love hanging around you guys since you make me actually use my se in meaningful ways you guys are also the nicest set of people could hope to meet always helping remember years ago during high school would have these repeating thoughts in my head that just felt empty on the inside almost as if never had heart at all it was painful time in thicks1 had most of those problems when was in high school would do silly

being busy she might lose interest and forget 1 ve always been able to read people instantly know what they re feeling but as ve never bothered to understand and accept their emotions rather dismissed

much effort to just flew back home from london today actually what did today 1 ate some doritos 2 bought pepsi 3 snacked while read looking for alaska by john green 4 listened to something the intps know are total goofs don really consider them relationship material used to love to read basically lived at the library during my teen years and as always had troubles falling asleep d read into the early hours becoming one with the book as pericles said you and the whole rest of the world if had dollar for every time someone said haven slept in hours days with stupid smirk on their face think you could figure out how rich d be well it only nightmare if you fear the fear don mind being afraid in my dreams just shows me ve got something to work on always have lucid dreams don think ve ever had you ve already said it show them get the dog and make it an experiment could turn out that you re wrong as well take my mind off it let me vent or simply give me space and ll come around are you simply humoring people or do you actually believe the things you just wrote to me it means respecting the other persons boundaries it means talking to them in an adequate manner keeping my promises and making sure don speak do anything they wouldn want me to behind don think ve ever had nightmare in my life ve had dreams where ve been chased and shot for example but since m usually aware that m dreaming just view it as an opportunity to grow love dreaming especially lucid dreaming it one of my favorite activities thus think of sleeping as highly enjoyable and probably sleep way more than should don need lot of sleep eugh hate intuition well no hate having to trust something without real evidence or logic backing it up annoying at the same time am trying to develop my inferior functions to be more well just started working in fairtrade shop and like brian1 said no point in talking about yourself unless it to convince the customer of the value of the product the shop is really tiny and just if you constantly question why people even have emotions seriously why can people just bounce back and chill and why you re expected to consider them you re an estp if you like tending to so what the point agius32 thanks man the descriptions are more spot on than the majority of those in the article section definitely at the point where try to reap the benefits from these stress factors such as as others have said not on the internet we re on an adventure obviously 1 currently considering psychology but m not that sure 2 no clue 3 open in what aspect there different ways to give person an insight to your life analyzing linear logical thinking choice lucky for you did character strength 1 bravery you are courageous person who does not shrink from threat challenge difficulty or pain you speak up for what is right even if agius32 wouldn say can speak for the rest of estp land need any of those tips am respected by others and don need to fake silly gestures or carry myself super swag like i don like cheese by itself however if it on sandwich or feta cheese in salad etc that delicious interesting think of myself and other estps as strong enough not to let it get to them when other people come and spew their shit basically just roll my eyes and think wow that original loyalty and respect there not much wouldn do for those consider my best friends and well in order for me to consider you my best friend in the first place you have to be willing to go to get uncomfortable when spend too much time in my own head it not just the fact that as an extrovert am externally focused want to be the majority of time time unless introspection is socionics and mbti are two different things they don always correlate turning 20 in two days and d say this the best and worst years at the same time mean you ve suddenly got all this responsibility to shoulder while you still feel like lost kid and you ve agius32 you sure do seem to care lot to be estp don think ve noticed anyone else get beat up by the outdated stereotypes and negative comments about our type personally find them we re out of booze and stereotypical descriptions of ourselves so we come here hoping people like you will provide us with some more we re not as vague vs certain enfjs well what you can conclude from the lack of answers is that estps don like vague questions suggestions such as tell me about yourself you be better off constructing set of questions that when you look into the sun yeah that color called yellow it turned into you know you re yourself and just like everyone else when you do or here look at the quirky things do that make me special thread nope don apologize to people constantly intend to offend them won listen to word you have to say don care about anyone or

the process of getting involved with someone and opening up want the emotion he claims to have if only was able to let loose in his company more have no way of knowing if okay m on my way to my work trip and have just enough time to comment on this in fact for me dialling phone is not simple task suck big time at that and other such tasks that people yes would my problem is and aways has been that find extremely few men exciting this is why try to give things every possible chance to develop further every time happen to encounter i ll keep this short today as m in work rush inferno very helpful in thinking less about the guy but ll say this he has been actively carrying the development of our relationship contacted will record some steps of my disengagement from him on this already branched out thread just to make them more tangible for myself it will be very hard effort as the sense of belonging have princessjay what an amazing analysis thank you very much for this that me for sure ve never become this involved though and then again have with my ex it just felt lot different as princessjay he is able to guard his boundaries with crazy women by now as he been practicing lot but this causes more craziness on her end as it feels super bad when he doesn let her as okay so realize how this thread is turning into my personal diary of sorts and don think the development can be reversed at this point sorry today get an sms from my neighbour oh wow fueley they would be correct you should not worry least of all about posting on some online forum when you have that going on nothing significant has happened anyway and m soon off to yeah definitely not my style it ll be fair game or no game even if sometimes feel like he wants me to manipulate him into wanting me more ethical ways of making him feel for me could be m not so surprised he knows what my ex is like for one thing he in fact the only guy ve felt can talk to about my ex in the hopes of him being able to see past it with all the others this belief would be far fetched in any case but as of this morning there has been an additional factor in play that can no longer dismiss woke up with the realization that want to have in that case you should be rooting for me and the guy ending up together because you know who going to be next in line if this thing fails the other entp met on tinder and you know which one don see your post as judgmental at all fueley one thing is for sure there will not be blame game of any kind no matter what happens m sure he knows this too ve been absolutely wow fueley what treat this is you ve written amazing was at low point when wrote the recap now m feeling okay even excited looking back the low points are gradually less and as per requested by dear fueledbyevil season 3 of this twisted fucked up saga is about to begin or end have no idea which recap of what happened since the previous post 1 as we was just on my way to making this exact comment thanks for saving me the trouble guess in fact logged in here to start discussion like this one asking if other intps are happy with in my book it is possible to ask questions in non questioning manner yes yes yes and yes m actually still talking to him over email and have suggested we meet one last time because forgot to give him some chocolate brought him from my work trip dude you break my heart seriously loving it ve felt for long time that this is what it is and also that he wishes me to grow the hell up and sees how it will still take long time we well have learned to cry already long time ago and m now quite accomplished if say so myself also learned to feel all my feelings openly wasn easy and apparently m still thank you so much for post full of beauty know my way into reveling in sorrow all too well during the past few years it become regular rehearsal to just submit to it that seems the geniusoverlord you made me cry with your post it so absolutely spot on and accurate in every detail feel like have been seen my situation has been validated and my love interest has been thanks desthro for the pat in the back wish my sexuality was as straightforward as you suggest m unable to want any other person than the one love so first in order will be disengaging well we met and discussed things and it looks like there no point in continuing to invest in other words we ended it not really strictly but from all practical viewpoints it over the my radar about men tends to be fairly accurate so ve come to trust it lot when see something good will hold on to it as long as there any stamina left in me this happens so rarely and totally on point everything you said 3 as know he been mistreated by women before definitely do not want to do anything like that to him myself like let him chase me and then get bored interesting definition m so happy that there are already three accomplished individuals on the entp forum who have been able to give very valuable information without which it would have taken what he could have said word for word can believe there are people out there here that seem so much like him as he is the only such one ve ever met on the other hand one would assume fueledbyevil totally enjoy your rambling please keep at it haldir would you care to elaborate on your question about intp female sexuality what specifically are you referring to with the if may elaborate on this his relationships have mainly fallen in one of 2 categories 1 traditional woman high degree of primal lust but weak mental connection and weak compatibility with good question will get back to it next time right now ll go get some sleep and wait for the answers that will surely come know other things we could do besides just handling it and you re right this used to be me then met him still learning the ropes it all so foreign but very very nice to me redface new haldir blush that kind of what meant when said high maintenance meaning maybe m expecting too much effort from his part while resting on my laurels your comments seem to awaken some perfect way to illustrate what we need the axis perfect perfect ll be considering this right before fall asleep tonight for sometimes answers come in dreams especially answers to my oh my you re being waaaay too gentle trying to rub this in much appreciated at any rate hard headed touche you re actually telling me the same thing the guy has been trying to tell me he haldir what superbly clever analogy and do love analogies the especially intriguing thing about this particular analogy is that although have zero knowledge about baseball was edit may just to clarify are you saying if he is demanding with regards to partners and not chasing me then your point 2 applies regardless of other factors such being that he likes me and why have not thrown myself at him because want him to clearly choose me first meaning lose the less interesting and unstable but fuckable woman he has been seeing casually and stop oh can totally use all the bad news can get at this point bring it on yeah anything to help me destroy what feel for him sadly don think there anything you guys can say to really do he is right for me and have no doubt that his heart is pure what he says is not bullshit ever when there are contradictions it because he is undecided or hasn thought about the topic forgot to answer this he says he considering if he even wants love relationship of the type m going for serious committed loving long term etc he said he hasn before met woman he dear fueledbyevil thanks for the comment so much has happened probably haven been clear about the things you point out so outlining it here 1 yes he has been honest and jeez something just occurred to me again and turned quite lot around in its occurring he isn rejecting me really he is testing me yes but in the most loving way possible also just so as not to appear as crazy stalker lady which am though want to point out that the above message represents fantasy won be acting on it as it would probably creep him out big something occurred to me just now he hasn replied my email which sent on friday trying to clarify some details of our discussion on thursday night this is not super uncommon for him but the okay so the saga continues we took it slow up until came back from my business trip

about parts of who we are the one that people see the most prodominatly is our puking rainbows my secret ready this will change your life do it it really no hard okay okay ll repeat it again do it it my motto and it works every time when get stuff done not can emotionally detach quickly if had reason guilty as charged go go get em tiger tip most of them have met hate poor posture puff your chest out thats intersting have very close intj friend who says the best thing we share in commen is the desire to travel he and are both very curious about the world and want nothing more then to only like million intjs are the icing to cake for me love all humans and lot of them intrest me but nothing like an intj need at least on active intj friendship to keep me so ll spend lifetime annalyzing my past predicting my future living in my present how would have room for you in my heart ve built my love around this the kindness of others the she sounds like great gal know an intj who is in love notice he is much more affectionate and lately even struggle to get an objective opinion that isn saturated with feelings although they are always very get very internal when im stressed and try and tell myself im okay as result of my this doesn work out well ve developed many colds and flu from being stressed out as long as my intj companion hates it when make assumptions about how he feels even if m right he also hates it when make negative assumptions about myself without listening to his input which really enjoyed reading this think your quest is noble and is good one have never had real want for money maybe it was the way was raised but found the times was happiest your enfp brethren extend there love to you m skye cant say have to much experience in this area but have loved and ill tell you bit about it as someone who does love very only really like people that the connection is quite clear between the two of us where there is no denying we are into eachother otherwise don really get interested well may but don i say your right yes thought might be entp for while to but realized have just developed thinking and rely very heavilty on analyzing would agree that alot of people think just hello so the movie the giver is coming out thought would read the book before it does m wondering if anyone who has read the book knows the receivers character profile ve looked it your jointing very interesting set of people spent lot of time trolling on the intj forums m telling you it leaves me in stiches everytime im sure you will enjoy yourself welcome play guitar and ve learnt drums but don get lot of chance to use that skill since don have set yet and sing if m good or not is debatable regularly play with group haha the two estjs know we spent months and montthhhhhhhssssss trying to change eachothers mind and get us to see eachothers point of view when we finally learnt to agree to disagree it kinda maybe to those who break down the iron gates what can say too much time with feeler lately laughing wink quote can imagine why from the coupple who have been interested in me the first thing they always say is that broke down lot of emotional walls usually without even trying and that they are attracted to my aura truth is there is always something standing in the way of love and it may not happen naturally like so many people say that it something that happens and is totally un breakable think love slightlyeccentric now just wait for the comments that m sensitive touchy feely person laughing quote you are sensitive touchy feely person d say our ability to play wingman is extensive yes the enfp are here for you im going through break up with an intj now to but much different situations to yours won go into it here but if you need to talk please pm me m not no problem glad was able to help think honesty in any relationship is inportant but especially with enfp and intj since enfp get almost all there information not from what people say haha unfortunately we are just friends sigh haha yes usually much more so think it surprise like one time was talking to friend intj actually and its not like we were really that close mean we were but he didn know me yes because we are both just as crazy as the other constantly it exhausting know about 14 different greetings and yet still no complete language ahhhh d say you re pretty dead on and we are not always aware we are doing it often when m talking to some friends who know me really well they look at me funny and say something like what are you here what im thinking just going from my own experience with intj he likes you and think lot of this has more to do with his love language the main one seeming to be acts of love you re signature haha thanks for you opinion this is the exact same thing thank you for those positive vibes but m doing pretty well would you like them back or you good xoxo yes do understand now thank you appreciate that insight understand much more now he is typed as an enfp ahh that makes much more sense yes agree no that what was highlighting is that the stubbornness could be j or that it is not just s or s that do that defiantly agree with but again that stubbornness to not be controlled can be contributed to an enfj just as much enfp d say reading people is what rely on most of the time it interests me and if its not too vain it makes me feel important and validates my worth so yeah d say m very good at reading and think peeta is an enfp but can anyone explain why they think he is p not j because he tends to manipulate the world around him according to how he wants it he doesn exactly let things interesting theory but if remember correctly her test itself she shouldn tell if it was real or not but it was only in the mental stage she could but that was her divergence not her hmm think istx but m leaning towards because she doesn really have the desire to control the world around her but lets the world evolve and she just fits into it and the fact she no no put this thread up to get your opinion thanks for it he sounds very immature by enfp standards to if that possible know an enfp like that see most enfp protect there inner world from the ones who don care to look for it but an intj do not love broadly they love specifically and intensely an intj in love will be driven to understand that person especially if that is challenge enfp love all however for thats true she does have few but there are many instances where she doesn let emotion involve her decisions or her actions and doesn even consider how she feels until well after the event had an intj friend who would have that song am wrong by nico and vince at the part that he sings thats just how feel ready at any and all times when talking to me because use to haha explains why don watch tv then has no backbone as an nf can say yeah that about 90 percent of what we do ',\n",

tells me m an extravert but my mom had to pay me candy bar to go socialize for 20 minutes the other night so hmm well that makes me sound like fat loser anyway haha was at bible study once and this girl was like pouring her heart out about her body image issues when spaced out and started remembering an awkwardly funny conversation with boy about how never at all m the little quiet bunny fluff in the group probably the person looking most easy to get away with things with because m so chill and often let others have their way and m not my brothre wants big family no epic line ending for me someone once told me should be an exotic dancer though hahahaha am they may be unsuccessful bringing me out of my shell but if they play their cards right they can come in twss mm yes agree entirely though hadn really thought much about it before haha that awesome if you re looking for wise probably college but ve had this whimsey for awhile to save up for trailer buy dog and hit the road for

inviting problems by cited definitions reality darkbarlow my point is that really do find that thoughts are objects you can pick them up drop them observe them compare them build them up break them down the thoughts and beliefs you that was my point yes the argument was made that they are different fundamental things was attempting to point out the difficulty in supporting that idea they appear in different forms but all the same thing much simpler now lol so they are objects of thought as opposed to objects of the senses then do they have different source just thought treating thoughts as material objects can increase or decrease their perhaps for some for me it interesting enjoy life quite bit thank you although not because m not going to die in war is that real enjoyment well at least m not doing some find practicality to be worthy ideal find it impractical to use contradictory definitions using one hand to build house won prevent you from building house it be more m unsure if you re saying this as sort of extrapolative support of what am saying but that pretty much how see it the map is not the territory and we can know the territory we glad we are in agreement the standard definitions which cited don make much sense stickman to be honest all that really perceive in your post is bunch of overcomplicated false dichotomies thanks for sharing though ll try to put myself in your mental shoes when precisely although tend to think in more of wim hoff maybe shaolin monk type of direction than goku perhaps goku eventually though give me few lifetimes at the party m the one playing the music and after that m either being intimate with person from the party or book and some tea i not at all worried about it nor am at all worried lol made typo in the thread title that a bit upsetting has anyone else ever realized how we appear to be getting programmed with this bullshit dichotomous definitions about the very nature of the world itself check it all definitions via google godel incompleteness theorems man say it again and again but it really all you need if you can wrap your head around its multiple dimensions hahaha right not only are you already time traveler it by time traveling that you re able to experience the universe in sequential manner at all but because each point in time is its own in sense but you re coming at the idea from perspective within which time is integral you re talking about growth which is bit like if were to say isn time objective because it in psychological sense yes it exists because we experience it however the idea is more that mechanically speaking it isn an objective process in the universe time doesn exist outside nobruisesonherego interesting did you read my little post about this very thought process we come from similar spaces ll write longer response to this question as it is interesting as have to get going soon though ll just say find in science the truth that the mind is useful tool in guiding and precisely godel incompleteness all knowledge must be based on unprovable axioms knowledge is the extrapolated product of belief in an axiom which is itself unprovable if you believe one exactly for the record do not believe the experience is in any way meaningless in fact feel the ideas within this thread grant greater depth of meaning and appreciation for life and in any case had thought process last night after sharing these ideas personally rarely say that know anything prefer to say believe things this is partly because of this iama carlton you have both stated that no matter one mental state you cannot believe away pain first off cite an individual whose mental state allows him to do just that ve come to very much this same conclusion myself let have some fun according to wikipedia on epistemology whether someone belief is true is not prerequisite for its belief on the other hand if something is actually known annnnddd this is exactly what am saying the divergence is semantics it just on how we are defining real and how in my mind it appears as though you are shifting your definition of also the analogy of the dream here works well you dream at night you re creating universe of sorts would say it not that you create the dream upon falling asleep and then cease somewhat mitigated in my mind by the idea that only the moment exists the creation happens every moment as the time we use to relate to the rest of the creation is part of the creation it isn actually my favorite analogy for these sorts of things is tolkienic myth eru illuvatar you might read the silmarillion with these thoughts in mind and see what connections can be made of hahaha yea this thread is actually quite old m mostly here for new conversations and explorations not so much to inform so won be sending you anywhere on informing people being an darkbarlow very interesting to reread this thread and our conversations in it it been years it nice to feel change feel like wouldn have said some things or maybe don think entirely let us forgo such formal and dichotomous notions as correct and incorrect in this discussion no your inductions are correct for you given your thought processes and viewpoint m sure you will prefer to think of even the ebb and flow as product of experiencing the universe as component rather than as the whole mind that we actually are it reminds me of kirchoff laws in never staying out of trouble d hope you re not playing it too safe indeed feel this is very true within certain paradigm of thought feel you are correct as it relates to our if time is indeed not an objective process in the universe but rather subjective perception it would not appear to be possible for the brain to be the source of consciousness as the brain is some will answer some already have for my whole life have been driven to distill to question everything come across and attempt to break it down into its most essential and love your darkness for it makes you whole wait until you get to the wheeler dewitt equation also godels incompleteness theorems once again it actually is interesting in that it has few levels of understanding at first glance it think lot of people see infj as flirtatious but you re really the only person who can decide that right the ni fe tandem requires sort of connection in order to function correctly understand godels incompleteness theorem and you understand why it isn possible system is finite and possibilities are infinite no equation or idea can ever encompass infinity of course 162002 relevant d say it be perfection the shadow of ti is that it wants the perfect explanation perfect system and perfect answer one with no contradictions and with impeccable and unassailable logic we are generally selective but not in the way infjs tend to be we also really like word play for the sake of it and sometimes that comes across as flirtatious it usually kinda is hahaha ti motivated by wealth with all due

the other day was shifting from second into third but was too busy thinking about nuclear energy and forgot to push in the clutch needless to say it ground my old thread but ll give my input regardless sounds like keynote depression and despite what others are saying doubt thinking things out is going to have any real positive effect feeling people with addictive personalities can take stimulants without problems general rule of thumb is starting at the lowest dose and see if it something you can manage without abusing stimulants yeah wellbutrin along with straterra are pretty common go to drugs but their efficacy is highly debatable for the treatment of adhd ve noticed that psychiatrists will usually go to stimulants in all honesty ve dealt with lot do mean lot of adhd add it one in the same really cases and you don strike me as prime candidate again m not doctor could just be past medical history adhd maybe mean if it adhd you re probably gonna wanna switch to some sort of stim medication blah blah blah m not doctor in all honesty think natural meh just get prescription for vyvanse and you ll find all of your motivation happiness and willingness to work come right back remember without fear lot of us if not most of us would already be dead by now m sure am an intp where 100 81 sanders as the highest 7 trump as the lowest no know entjs estps are usually the ones that need leading having someone push what they think is best when what you want is the exact opposite on you is beyond irritating have an entj intp entj natural partner wut for the most part almost every entj ve interacted with has made themselves out to be domineering asshole if group work with an entj is almost down right blasphemy most novel ideas are planned poorly and their sequels are generally just cash cow offspring that don really progress the plot do mindfulness stuff daily helps cut back on my day time generalized anxiety bunch in turn reducing the amount of valium gotta take each day as well problem is once my vyvanse wears off in kinda sorta deja vu is driven more by forgetfulness while ocd is driven more by fear of forgetting in this instance at least ocd manifests itself in many ways like to use the door knob this doesn seem like much of an si problem this is appears to be much more related to an anxiety disorder having gad myself get to experience the wonders

safe what can tell if this is just terrible bait or if you actually believe that which like said sort of is impossible if they re not using any these are literally people who will not believe they are wrong you can get as simple and kind as you like but if your argument then they say something like applesauce disproves your argument you can really reason with anyone if well they re unreasonable the problem is that they can let their emotions go or yeah that was my first move and always is my first move getting them to see something even they can deny as irrefutable guess the only problem is that when they re in storm of volcanic rage yeah know there are plenty of nf nts that are powder kegs which is why found it interesting that it was really only the sf sts that wrecked the debate out of the past 13 wrecked debates 11 of m going to answer my own question you don you just walk away however keep running into hordes of sf st types mean it just one after the other for infinity it seems that

              " ' any infj having relationship with enfp being the infj older how this could work this enfp thing that they need to try everything out before knowing what they want or like would not be hello dear infps m so happy with all the answers for my post thank you very much hugs it very helpful to read your answers love my infp but m scared to tell him that he still effy thank you think you are right and also my guts and don like the fact that m feeling led on have the feeling that he values me and would like to love me because he knows m sometimes wish was extroverted and not monogamous but then like who am contradictory hello again dear infps have some questions 1 how do you act when you love someone 2 are you aware of your feelings or do you need time to process then and realise it how long does don get rid of it it very useful for many things you ll see just try to always have in mind that it can be different than what you think expect good luck necrosis you are creating whole universe inside your mind about what happening to him and maybe the way he treated you before and is treating now is just coincidence and has nothing to do so my cute infp is coming back slowly he even brought me chocolate tongue what kind of small things make you happy in relationship what can scare you off and make you run away restlesscryptid what kirjuri said also the half laugh tend to do that when want to cry but m controlling it smile and depending on the situation start talking non sense it was rebecca i really like your advice problem is m always hungry and cook for myself maybe it better if start to meet the guy after eat not bad idea actually well this time that actually makes lot of sense what if the guy was being nice and cool and doing this things to me as well and then he changes after while my best friend is an entp and was kind of in love with him for long time hizumi didn know there were other infjs in the offline world as well tongue it like that start by being friendly nice if really like the guy start to invite him over i mostly talking about love relationships here was thinking if because we are so giving we tend to attract selfish people or if in our pov everybody will look bit selfish to us or uh oh much better bunch of women screaming at the same time who in well that funny my infp date was having this kind of behaviour with me throwing futons crying being mirror and also option when was being kind to him hm what wrong with you been in the exact same situation before what wrong with these ppl may not speak for all infjs so have in mind that maybe it different with him but to be honest have this talking outbursts sometimes not always and if he doing it with you it probably could an unhealthy infp become manipulative out of being afraid of loosing control in relationship or out of jealousy for example let help me make shitty breakup that kind when the person says they still want to be with you but disappears at least bit fun you could start by helping me figuring out nice plan to infj been compared to maggie from the walking dead my ex told me that mostly because of the looks but personality fits as well wendy from peter pan don know why this is long time and cold every little day thing word said or left to be said hurt as hell dear infp may sound extremely silly but think that real love when it happens it happens for both parts just came back to re read my last post and apologise for my non native speaker english when you decide as life philosophy to respond to verbal aggression with smile and love and that what you call being passive aggressive in good way sereneone that video is brilliant thank you very much ve spoken to my enfp friend about all this also fi right and she helped me seeing the situation from another angle as well need to ve finished an 8 year relationship after moving together with the guy to new country was so worried about his feelings that waited for moment where he realise for himself this was not this is very phenomenological of you ve done that before but only on paper thanks for sharing thinking on how we re all alone together hi five that a very good insight thank you very much but ve made mistake actually the guy is an infp not intp as far as remember my is much more developed than his my biggest problem with entheos your post helped me in many ways thank you lot really ve already talked to him about this at least it was start last time we met felt so disconnected that started to like this guy lot and really like the fact that he is sensitive it hard to find people who are more sensitive than am also don really care if he not manly my problem is maybe with do you often find yourself thinking about what your mission on this planet might be m dating this infp guy since 5 months and it very hard to access how he feels about me specially because he is very introverted have hard time communicating and sometimes not self aware of ah ok now get it m still knowing how intp works so can add much to that see him getting passive aggressive lot but without telling me directly if he upset that stresses me lot hm normally d agree but it just doesn sound like him well time will tell the truth now he lost the opportunity to meet in person since m back to where live in another country ve never thought he might be sexually attracted to me as said before m not his type he flirts but guess it his style had no doubts about friendzone my original question was why is if you assume since the beginning he wanted sex right that would also be my first assumption but then again we are friends since two years he never did this type of thing and afaik he never so what happening with my entp friend if he arranging meetings with me and cancelling the last minute this is not his mo at all he done that 3 times in the last week and live in another had no idea it usually helps me think it helps if person really likes you and do the best to understand you this way you can talk and talk the person asks you answer etc m just not sure if the guy is that willing to chocolate got sick have very fucking hard exam on friday have 13 hour flight on monday not so much time to study my brain is not working to focus on study ll get very bad note and m very oh yeah 100 this guilt is truly annoying m having this problem lately with the guy m dating as well and finding the balance between being totally there for them and totally selfish is very that really nice they say you just find the one after you stop looking right love my friend but he is not monogamic guess this is common in entps so m more than happy with the you re lucky think that exactly the biggest self growth personal issue m facing now kinda lost hope that ll find someone that gets me when your enfp friend says you build up entire universes inside your head with tons of different possible outcomes to situation when you are afraid of exposing your true feelings to your friends can know about him but recently had big conversation with an entp friend about guy m dating this guy was very rude to me just because he was in bad day and didn even realize it m putting myself in the conversation think m arriving in that point as well had an 8 years relationship and thought he was the man of my life felt he was my best friend and the only usually create things like songs or texts or smth artistic so don feel unproductive if not listen to music or meditate feel those moments are productive as well to give me energy ',\n",

have at times they are but just from observation and personal experience ve seen they aren always like said think it for the most part individual preference it really hard to type based on these questionarres usually just do it off of vibe or getting to know someone and you still might be you just really remind me of an isfj friend that have you scored 48 333 out of 100 masculine points 44 167 out of 100 feminine points and 53 509 out of 100 androgynous neutral points female intj mirrors are not always ideal as ve seen think it just individual preference type only goes so far in choosing such things my friend who self identifies as isfj is looking to pursue psychology but say just go with your gut and what you personally think you enjoy weigh natural intj here and for awhile was like this too my advice learn metathinking basically make it point to become aware of what you re doing why you re doing it what you re thinking no problem struggled with this lot myself so if you have any other questions feel free to ask me xd xd that probably because lot of us go down similar path then meet and it like whoa ah okay never really got into that series maybe because was forced to read it for school but m not an expert with this but based on personal experience settled on intj for myself because of how my fi plays out as in isfps have dominant fi and intjs have fi as their third function you remind me lot of myself actually from about year or two ago but ve changed lot since then my advice to you is to not worry too much about what type you are ve learned that knowing xd well think m naturally an intj now with developed functions but went through stage where was convinced was isfp also went through intp entp and infp stages and still relate lot to xd well the guy m with is most likely entj so suppose m attracted to that type and it a very interesting dynamic female intj male entj so based on the information you ve given in this post you seem lot like friend that have who self identifies as isfj although you both don seem like stereotypical isfjs just what struck death note mirai nikki future diary that is really true have friend who identifies as intj but is obviously istj there just no ni in her at all but since she thinks she too intelligent and sees herself as superior to the sj edgar allan poe and william butler yeats in my true essence m just me much more extroverted and free suppose haha exact same although am rarely very comfortable doesn have many friends so mostly introvert introvert however when m in one of my environments so to speak and

when we were with people he ignored me and acted quite differently felt couldn be bothered reading all of this m not even sure if my late reply will be read but here my two cents for j am not very well disciplined at all actually see me as an enfj gone agree and think that while we are young are functions haven really had the time to go too far from our first two and there so much inexperience to the world my estj ex would act mature and hmmm think liked his logic and m sort of wacked up enfj and don really go around softening things up m really happy you said this could work there is so much negativity on it it question is it bigger turn on if girl is all dolled up or natural honestly have days where feel introverted and days where feel extroverted there was something really wanted to ask and now ve completely forgotten the istp know goes on the internet and designs shoes like the way he dresses but don think he cares he loves his shoes though is this completely uncommon m not sure if this is common for enfj but speak in metaphors good amount of time also it not exactly the metaphor it like the meaning of the metaphor had nothing to do what was this yep pretty much so you guys are really misunderstood or just more straight forward with how you feel so people think you are jerks pretty much can relate to everything you said kiwigirl m the same won start something unless know might actually do really good job at it or will be really good at it haha awesome thanks for watching and replying you pretty much nailed the relationship have with my infp friend ll be trying to logically explain something to her and she will kind of he is 18 he has actually got pretty rough home life and he isn smart like he is not smart person and he knows it he did terribly in school and think feeling inferior to everyone and haha maybe should have been little more in depth about my question answering thanks everyone for your responses hahaha m exactly the same always get people to make snap decisions for me but then of course don agree with their decision sigh haha interesting interpretations thanks oh and always needing affection thrown at us if the enfj is well developed enough we will already know how someone feels about us we won need it to be proven all the time only just read this after posting mine honestly what read about xnfj enfj especially on the internet compared to the ones that know including myself are only similar to point the don mean to boast but complicated and unpredictable yet having their shit together we would be good friends haha think that there are certain things that turn people on that types can relate to for example if you check the infj threads they mostly say that intellect and humor turn them on however if haha yes oh and thank you for sharing about your dad also could never marry enfp or infp so you re more accepting person than am thanks heaps for your reply it really hard talking about yourself because there soo much to summarize and no one is ever really going to fit it all in think have pretty 0 is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions for example stressful time mental illness medications special life circumstances other useful information includes sex aww alrighty ll chat to you for sure',\n",

gossip it i agree with most of this d say hannah is an exfp and adam is istp always making random crap and moving around ray is definitely an intj two of my close friends are entps one girl one girl the guy is more extroverted than the girl like how can be frank with entps and talk about basically anything under the sun something math and sciences especially advanced chemistry shudder m definite social science kid mindy is pretty enfp danny reminds me lot of myself especially in that episode with christina nude exhibit only an ixxj would be so self conscious and not want to draw attention to there has been common trend on this forum and basically any mbti site online to say that infjs and istjs don get along any type can get along it just based on your communication and bumping up this topic because found it interesting enfp know 3 and all very fun and great people to talk to about basically anything with only fault is that they love people and are often nobody has called me boring to my face think those who are judgemental enough to make that assumption without really knowing me are not worth my time anyway can guarantee that those who have infp get your head out of the clouds and use some logic hello infjs particularly male infjs what attracts you to girl what are things that she can do make herself be attracted to her also to all infjs what do you think of istjs ask because great as friends have the same taste in books and music as most of the intps that ve met their lack of planning can annoy an istj and they are mostly all lazy geniuses some are quite hey thanks for doing this amaa haha sorry if this has been previously answered but m too lazy to go through all 7 pages do you have any advice for me as want to go to law school and will be gifts are cool with me but don buy me gift for the sake of getting me gift d rather you just spend more time with me if like you but obviously would if you would think of getting me well this is an unfair judgement because don have 1 5 hours to spend listening to metal really don like metal music so wasn a fan of this to say the least the guy looks like bamf when you re accused of being dictator like with your direction by your friends also when you re constantly told how cold distant you seem and how you constantly bitch face the literal story of my life dry never said infjs can use logic just simply said nfs prefer not to rely on it my ex boyfriend is math major and my close friend is one as well another friend is science major but she also great at math they are all infjs what is it with math and infjs math is this guy pretty much summed up my views on moral absolutism humans of new york aubrey estj very goal oriented clear extrovert can be stubborn becca isfp doesn really socialize until singing with aubrey in the shower wants to be dj thus very artistically inclined honestly all the deeply profound things come up with are either stolen from nf users or said in the moment m pretty talkative and talk things out with friends then end up saying something think your problem lies within the fact that your teacher is very vague and not in the fact that you lack intuition like sublimeserendipity said everyone has intuition it just what you re the above posts pretty much describe how am with confrontation as well my isfj friend is very very unconfrontational and she literally runs away from confrontation think that is borderline yo enfj stop mingling and schmoozing so loudly get your heads out of the clouds and face reality infj you commented the same thing on my thread if you want more information create your own questionnaire otherwise don come in commenting on everyone thread with not really enough information to sure an emotionally healthy individual is someone who is content with who they are and where they think their life is going it varies from person to person but if they have something to live for honestly m not too sure of my type anymore feel like have changed lot and would appreciate any opinions 1 what fictional character do you identify with most ve gotten can identify with one or two of the istp qualities but am for sure not sp aren sp sensation seeking none of the adjectives chose really show that maybe you should add spontaneity for 1 3 pick one of the two answers that describes you most 1 outgoing reserved 2 talkative contemplative feel m balanced in both maybe bit more talkative 3 sociable solitary have found this one to be the most reliable personality test not big fan of the humanmetrics one feel like the sensitive douchebag is really prevalent social attitude in today society perfect example would be shia labeouf who is supposedly an infx what are your guys experience with being an sj myself tend to get along with other sjs get along with nfs the best actually and my friends are good mix of e but mostly ambiverted personalities like myself the things that we hate have far more influence on us than the things we like although don think this an unpopular opinion just one that is not expressed as frequently out loud the behaviour you stated sounds more estj than istj assuming that the rest of your typing is correct to begin with istjs generally don like being the centre of attention and we prefer get huge infp vibe from your answers or at least an xnfp like holysouljellyroll you are very much feeler and the whole cooking thing is very infp also have an infp friend that would 1 most of my friends are enfjs or infjs and our greatest difference is probably our feeling side as an istj m not very outwardly emotional also my infj friends tend to judge someone feel he one of my fave actors and ve watched most of his movies except mysterious skin and looper think he an introvert but do think that his e is very balanced either that or he just i find paying attention in lectures effectively studying works best for me use verbal regurgitation drives one of my friends nuts as we studied together one time bad idea lol most often to the people hating on this thread chill the out first off and second please re read my original post if you dislike this thread don post or follow along no one is making you if you which myers briggs types do you commonly associate the word asshole with obviously not every person of that type is going to be an asshole but find that some personality types are more this infj guy and have mutual liking but m reluctant to start relationship because can already sense the problems that we are going to have and they aren like little ones that you can agree with you to certain extent see him as damaged enfj perhaps he does possess some entj qualities though mr rochester is definitely an extrovert no doubt get strong enxj vibes either an enfj or entj it really does have it advantages sometimes do admit however would want to seem more approachable in certain situations like in work environment mentioned by sela outofplace so recently have been more aware or conscious you could say of my cold exterior it all started when this guy friend acquaintance say that because think we re friends but idk we m curious to why louis is typed as istj so often and by many m an istj but find myself relating to in terms of choices and actions mike my good friend is an enfp and adore her honestly think we have less differences than my infp friend per say or my entp friend don think istjs are the most charitable givers would lean towards the feeler types for that association personally as student do charity work and volunteer but definitely don have bump we need more positivity on the enfj sub forum the istj one has tons of pages mon guys ',\n",

for the kill all people fiind the same kind of stuff funny what surprises them or what makes them feel superior do not think type has anything to do with it but personally like situational humor the most summer all of the above cold beer is incredible during summer first get drunk with one or more friends then think about something fun to do you ll surely figure out something my most crazy or hell fun experiences were born this way hehe yeah can relate to that but as far as my experience goes mbti is pretty much useless as far as dating goes girls are girls no matter if they are estps enfjs or whatever but if you paying attention to what say and do seeming interested in my personality and my life not just my yeah pro choice yeah first of all wont trust your typing that she is an estp but she is cold coquette the type that now is warm now is cold now she flirts now she does not give fuck and she is playing would go with enfp you sound like fi auxiliary but do not seem impulsive enough to be an esfp or an estp who is worse that friend of yours sounds totally esfj and not at all estp many reasons for that most important of all being that you described her as very submissive towards people of authority se or ne well have the same problem or had ask me again in few months there is not much you can do but as an estp myself found out that while am good character reader often make wrong sure have to pick college and future profession but have some many options and so many jobs could do well that have no idea how to sort through them already droped from 2 colleges that the spirit good luck you are funny like stress out unless they are really intense about it no there is this one time girl who was just friend of mine went to party and she was there also few hours later she pulls me now that think about it now speak from personal perspective but what say may be common with other estps don really have friend zone for girls am not the type to make jack of all trades just flirt very directly but in playful manner strong intenses love you scare the shit out of me character strength 1bravery you are courageous person who does not shrink from threat challenge difficulty or pain you speak up for what is right even if there is opposition you act on your ok maybe am biased but can see you as an isfj you see have met lot of enfjs esfjs isfjs if you ask me this are by far the most common types and they are downright pushy when it comes it cool man for nighti well it also depends if you look at it from socionics or mbti perspective in mbti you only have 4 functions and also in mbti the inferior is conscious which is very wierd and hiding feelings does not mean fi user you should choose your sources better and as far as what he said let let him tell us what he meant for me it was the phrase am sure you can guess for nighti ok you got me flatery always works well there are lot of subtle details but the thing that convinced me was this m not sure m having hard time wrapping my brain hahaha am still pretty sure about istp could go into long argument about why he is fe inferior and not ne inferior but the truth is that it does not matter our sole purpose is to provide well have writen very long post to support istp but it got deleted so here is the short version you are very analytical in anything you do even describing pictures you seem to have not really actually fe is all about sharing as for your perception function could you describe the way you take in information in real life do you think details are important do you try to be yeah stick with infj no ma friend am not playing puzzles am just saying that she is extraverted because she is completely focused on the outside world also she feels good when others feel good and that is fe for raichu every1 doubts their type on some level usually because the descriptions are kinda inaccurate and they tend to put too much trust in them people are complicated actually feel it i would actually say you are ti dom you really don seem ni dom to me probably istp because you certain afinitty to adventure and seem very interested in just having fun and not caring but ne doms and se doms typically display this trait mhhhhhhhhh some kind of enfp or esfp hard to decide you seem extraverted and also seem to have fi secondary that means ne dom or se dom it is quite easy to confuse between the two of them ok so see lot of fe all over your post and at first you seemed introverted but on second thought you seem totally focused on the outside world how others feel what others have to say sorry can you rephrase that yeah pretty much any sensoric part of conflict se inferiors are usually disturbed even by harsh tones they think you scream at them saw this few times recently was kinda fustrated with read your post 5 times to be sincere please consider infj you are clearly intuitive but your intuition seems introverted to me especially beacause of your why questions and your insistence if you ask me isfp or esfp not sure think esfp more likely try figuring out if you are extraverted or introverted see no ne signs in anything you say but see some se especially in sounds more like joke to me personally say lot of things like that but rarely mean them more often than not they are half jokes or ways to get reaction from person when my father was possesed satan stoled my sister and went to hell to get her back when woke up was scared as fuck and covered in sweat like took sweat bath or something could not sleep hell will try it tonight souns like fun yeah you are probably right could you give some examples yeah same here never thought about this but seems have some simptoms always thought about it on the lines of hell this is how am can help it and no matter how much willpower oh yeah and some people are simply wierd and take offense at anything even remotely negative those are the people you should avoid well simple question do you even try to self censor because if you don then that a very good starting point and you should ignore the rest of my post it not like don say shit that just came home now just chilling and have no idea what to do lol yeah kinda to many things going on and no time to think in big social settings find it very hard to concentrate yeah same here yeah well don hate esfjs at all but truth is kinda try to avoid them what don like about them bad taste in music if song is on the radio then is very good to bad most of think got your answer if have been near someone when they needed me and then when am down and weak and all seems to fall apart and they are still near me then see that as loyalty and ',\n",

it on the waltons like many many poets but urge all infjs to check out rainer maria rilke especially in hi all whilst am not exactly losing sleep over this issue wonder if any enfps can advise thanks well have this enfp male friend not close friend exactly but we have lot of mutual had to doorslam an esfj year or two ago for similar bs no regrets in the last coupla weeks ive had to do same to pushy bossy overbearing enfj who decided that im some kind of pushover that read good method to try for ppl that test ad get differing results each time try answering the test used this one personality test based on jung and briggs myers type theory and years ago loved the french film rendezvous by andre techine think it came out in the 80s and starred juliette binoche and lambert wilson also enjoyed the 2 of the 3 colours trilogy well went out with an entp and although he wasnt ideal boyfriend material we got together cos of having intense and vibrant conversations from the minute we met he is uber intelligent and madly just watched brideshead revisited again so good except for the crazy bad ending haha the forsyth saga with damian lewis as soames was fantastic just pushed couple of films onto mate to watch both fantastic imo american beauty was one and in my father den was the other but these are just chosen from dvds that own not many well m realatively new to mbti and m relying mainly on me typing them and sometimes years after but have had serious relationships with at least 2 infps and fell hard for another but it went my mother is esfj and our relationship has always been rocky she likes to micromanage my life at myage my esfj sister fell out badly with twice now and still find she wants to argue over love tiramisu too or any soft squishy desserty thing like fudge too try and avoid these things for the most part like just not buy them and usually dont even keep sugar in my very sparse speaking as well into middleaged woman never married no children by choice and only 2 pretty lame relationships in the last 15 years yes am thinking am bound to be alone it used to sad topic for me well was really really keeeeen on this infp guy met 3 years ago from the second met him it was like pow to cut along story short made massive hash of pursuing him ok well m dog mad and am onto my third poodle of my life she sleeps in my bed as did the others try and take her everywhere with me she scruffy and groom her myself she don wear the only person would ever want to swap lives with tilda swinton turns out to be infj she my big girl crush otoh never could stand nicole kidman go figure have massive lots of infps on that list afaik cobain depp et al but thanks my dad is intp and d be surprised if jung was intp jung interests and topics were so broad arent intps meant to be more narrow in focus interest another thing jung writings really in new zealand cant see any other infjs here but would love to meet up if you are here ay kiwis ive been in volved indirectly in lawsuit brought by an entj he has cause has kind of cast himself as knight in shining armour that has ridden in and rescued some guy that he thinks has been awww this reminded me of something that happened long time ago my infp ex bf phoned me in another country out of the blue crying and said just want things to go back to how they were ps the girl you feel guilty about from the past why not write her letter as in not expecting any reply and just tell her the truth that you feel bad still bout how you treated her dont expect wow can also relate to much of what you ve said was in similar headspace for maybe 18 months of the last 2 years and have been in various similar circumstances at various times here my 2 well can let mess pile up at times but after while it really gets to me looking at squalour so ill have big cleanup and feel fantastic try and have place for everything and to be more stephen mitchell translations of rilke are amazing too and d highly recommend rilke to all infjs thanks for the pointer anyway will check it out enjoy the ching and jung was right into cant say making friends was problem in childhood and still am friends with my besties from high school days they live away from me but when we catch up its always just taking up as if we saw media beat ups over t that really does not matter have recently discovered the joys of gardening also drinking great coffee reading browsing all kinds of books and magazines op shopping thrift shopping never tire of this not only for have felt for many years that as humans we all have both good and evil in us feel that introverts look at themselves and see that maybe more than say some extrovert types would it like gotta say do know one esfj guy and hes doll would help anyone seems decent human being having said that loath 4 esfj females really hate them manipulative gameplayers the lot of em and lordy just watched real housewives of orange county omg they seem to be all that is

              " ' am willing to go out of my comfort zone but not in order to make myself into better person the main reason to do so is to experience something that would not be able to do if remained within right at this moment wish that had more time to vegetate damn its been so long am most definitely not into politics have been dragged into all this social justice stuff by my idealistic enfp girlfriend that said do have bleeding heart from what have read the sexiness factor is gender specific and it is intuitive we live in world in which the female gender is allowed to express feelings and the male gender is allowed to my flirt based on recent find so was reading naomi klein and the leap manifesto want to collaborate on personal manifesto then put on my most endearing and winning smile and wait doe nothing more to add here other than that think figure catwalk and rexmaximus each got different aspects right to summarize the good parts are clearly all there n combination e difference what exactly is insincere about his words and actions he is really not thinking too much he may be tired of playing the game and wants to know if you like him or not so that the two of you can am conflict averse but quite in tune with my feelings generally if person is close to me then hesitate to share my feelings however have found that the more acknowledge my feelings just finished three body problem decent book but not my best read good point interesting this is exactly how she seems to want it generally tend to be the type who has no idea what the experience is going to be itself but arranges the logistics as best can to eke out it seems though that am using listening in very specific way mean listening without solving she tries to solve if its me who is doing the talking and when she is doing the talking can this feels much more like an enfp than her it is almost like she wants to massage me to her point of view granted it is quite difficult for two people to share similar frames of references what haha this was an interesting insight think it comes naturally to intjs to not actually get in and help but to stand by its not that we are trying some deliberate strategy it just seems that what am finding is that she has her perspective and finds it hard to simply listen when another person shares theirs when it differs from her likewise when she agrees with someone she is equally quite the opposite of me there will be few times that will have an observation sometimes feel she doesn get what say but thats ok sounds interesting but makes sense what does my intuition is after having known my enfp for some time that the judgment that you see can be treated as water of duck back unlike an isfp or an infp whose judgment will extend itself to well first of all just got to acknowledge that enfps are one of the nicest for intj i know its generalization so will just say that for this intj the enfp am with is pretty cool let me my enfp girlfriend gets me shirts interesting socks and surprises me with notes or cards sometimes the choices work and other times they don but she doesn get upset if they don work so its all about hugs as in xoxo if you feel like it go for it thanks and hugs to you message therapy hugs back to you twitch its been while since hung out on pc need some pc hugs therapy don like unsolicited advice and have learnt to be very upfront about telling the other person when their advice is not necessary do ask for help with relationship questions just from an does anyone have mapping of the socionics type to mbti types am not looking for the mapping of intp to intj that can be found here how to convert mbti type to socionics type if not ni is an irrational function so would say that te would be drawn to fields where the deciding factors are objective if they keep their ni to themselves myself was drawn to stem field because naturally am not saying s are not represented in stem fields perhaps theoretical physics and math are heavily represented by s physics biology and chemistry that heavily draws on ni also am in stem however my infj friend says that intjs are drawn to stuff like policy for my part have observed predominance of istj istp isfj estp esfj in stem enfp mine is super caring loyalty haven had reason to mistrust even though can be flirtatious think she is flirtatious in an unconscious way beautiful and has no problems acknowledging fascinating guess you leave it to someone else to defend this beauty of the world against threats posit that it is the cycle of life and death that is beautiful dead blooms and leaves add to beauty road kill seems purposeless and senseless really really hate it to see dead squirrels yes indeed but how does one not look for answers while agree with what you say it leaves me feeling dissatisfied this is probably because must control my environment and am constantly dissatisfied with the way things are and then of agreed there is something very interesting about how beauty is really visualized at least for me when am extremely tired after hard days worth of work where have made real progress even naaaah this doesn make sense there is just something intuitively not right about it if am tired enough can switch off the cognitive knowledge and just let myself perceive things as they yeah pretty good funny thing about language even that seems to help rather than hurt listening to instrumental music provides the same level of satisfaction as music with words but reading what we know we know why do we need faith for that so are you saying that understanding garden in terms other than science offers way of understanding ourselves in deeper way that yes prefer that the interest in woman evolve in such way that it is obvious without any words and that it is mutual on the other hand have become quite comfortable with there being rules of are you saying that what you behold is more than sufficient that you don need heaven life after death why do we construct myths and stories to help us through and navigate life why not just just straight up need to find food to eat survive and procreate am starting to read the god delusion by richard dawkins and came across this quote at the beginning isn it enough to see that garden is beautiful without having to believe that there pretty much anything non classical and not live and these were rated questions the problem is the worst case scenario here don get what you want me to do and see it in your bodily reaction that would shred my self confidence no exactly the opposite it could be that you are anxious attached and he is avoidant understanding anxious avoidant attachment or just that you are anxious attached you may want to lighten up message or two in the main thing is as with anything else what value is it to me its not binary lie truth if find them pretty then say so without them asking me to say so if find them asking for it then do tell them that find their features pretty find myself such provocative title so little insight thanks for the good vibes am fairly blunt when it comes to reality not so blunt when it comes to perceptions as

my mom go do insert known to do task here me know my mom well if you know then why don you go do it yeah m not one m gonna guess the ej types are most likely to groupthink but m not entirely sure thoughts also which types are least likely to groupthink very true my guess is that 9s are the most idealized type thanks to our high levels of neutrality and inner tranquility but from the perspective of 9 it isn worth it to idealize any type hardly ever wear hats if at all nice new avatar btw dealwithit the entj m currently living with apparently has used his se via cooking amid other

popular proud goes and votes for 9 edit and 9th vote what number crazy it seems both of the isps seem to hold out relationships and get married longer than the esps also some stats from personality page highest percentage married from highest to looks back at thread riiiiiiiiiight so why did create this thread dry maybe too much like comparing an istp to an intp maybe an intp in ti si loop tend to be nit picky about my environment as well due to my high si so am and although my 5w6 is close m 9w1 have absolutely no 8 anywhere in my enneagram type at all not to mention it feels somewhat disturbing and unreal to do it all the time pstypes enneagram test results the distribution of your scores type one 15 type two m probably the one all the way to the right am now weird for looking well crazy maybe because enneagram isn as official and popular as mbti and so it hard to find broad real world stats tp and fp aren necessarily associated with pe function they re associated with dom aux ti and fi respectively anyway you could divide up the 16 types in number of ways of four ej ep not an sj but my mom who is an sj her parents are most likely esfj and istp why the discussion fine nothing heated up in here used to wear watch when was younger but watches tend to irritate my wrist so stopped besides there are other ways for me to tell time when it necessary also beware under 1

in my dreams 2 often like most other things remember dream quite vividly but the they ll probably get along quite well this is probably true for any xwy with ywx btw if you were wondering the little between the numbers stands for wing not with it can be unclear ve wondered how common each of the 9 fundamental enneagram types are does anyone know or have link from typelogic com intuition is tertiary as the esfj matures and as situations arise which call for suspension of criticism ne is allowed to play under the leadership of the fe function from typelogic com as the estj matures and as situations arise which call for suspension of criticism extraverted intuition is allowed to play under the leadership of the te function again sorry if am harsh try not to take everything here personally if you look inside the parentheses there my alternate possibility m not inconsiderate it turns out was just tend to apologize like that too very reasoned out maybe it a f thing this obligation of sjs not just estjs amid others is what drives me up wall sometimes my esfj mother has this tendency to do this to me although not to the degree you re encountering find this interesting never would ve guessed that an estj would tell white lie this in part due to my stereotypical views of estjs as thinking type might get thrown off by this and not to be harsh but speaking of lies you could be lying about your strong stj it looks like you re just strong either that or could be misreading the scale so another question what here a third istp to add to that will say though that because of my autism have an unusually strong si it could happen to an isfp and the result could be an autistic isfp with isfj here replied to your thread happy crazy anyway once read that ifps such as you don seem to have much patience with types whose preferences are strongly or let alone tj mostly se and ni rule with ti so don need work there te and fi are doing ok and they will develop better in my later life ne just suck at and fe m not too good with either both s why do you terms and conditions have to be so long do you have any idea how discouraging and redundant that is ever heard of plain english and not legalese need to get out more recurringthoughtofmine sounds like you need to relax it also sounds like you need to forgive your intp detached perceiving nature maybe he got quickly bored thanks to everyone here who shared their two sided se understanding remember my high school enfj teacher taking us outside during homeroom se relief proud first impression estj maybe with strong se certainly underdeveloped in terms of cognitive functions such as ne and fi it looks like you have just won out the rest of us either that or you weren being true to yourself istj cup of coffee estj judge mallet for lack of proper name if there is one istp someone fixing up their cool vehicle be it car motorcycle bicycle or otherwise isfp an artist the question is will it be because we humans could control ourselves or because mother nature forced us would guess this is an si thing given my strong si have become like this as well however being an sp don need routine just need to know how it works find it fascinating that some isfjs have higher te than ti it had me wondering if most other sjs have higher te and fe than their ti and fi when my esfj mother tested out she had higher te how nostalgic are you it would appear that si nostalgia is fairly strong among you esfjs being si aux wondered where this thread went has thought of music and therefore cannot be described from an istp with aux se this is an insightful thread ve sometimes wondered if enfjs or enxjs for that matter experience se in here and now manner like sps do can imagine like any identity

tend to turn to god lot even when m not feeling like anything in particular feel like god is my family like watchful parent and when ve been so distraught ve felt woah so are mine my dad the istj and my mom the isfj my siblings are istj ixxx seriously we ve tried to type her and we think she a psychopath because she just can be typed intj ve been i from this site for couple of days and not replying to anything anyone because from time to time need mental break from my current obsessions xd ll reply to all of the my sun sign and ascendent are taurus my moon is virgo and my venus is in aries have lot of earth and fire in my chart which think wouldn give off the impression to other people that m aha you must have had an interest in me when was crushing hard on you m so stupid to have not realized it but it okay cause would have made terrible insecure girlfriend and wasn orangeappled your post is just everything would say on the topic of fashion and would create million accounts just so you could get million thanks on it m surprised too that most see thank you she is an infp and not an enfp lol and omfg love that cat so much always have dogs coming up wanna be licking me but if had that cat around d be protected for life and well you ll see because already know pp and thank you so much my parents are hermits and don really try to live in any world of theirs think they re unhealthy and ultimately scared locofoco you re forgetting kdramas 3 my guilty pleasure is gossip girl and anything kardashian related honestly would get so tired imagine okay when you re having conversation and you re talking and then while you re talking you can already read this person mind and so you re concentrating oh my god forgot to mention this xd dress for myself but there have been times where have regretted so much being complacent with my frizzy hair or having chosen boring conservative outfit my dad is an istj too which is probably m like you and would want to avoid that kind of clash xd ah the freudian complexes that still hold superstitious roots in our society and for this chica no just no ahh m so happy someone got the reference 3333 to stay on topic really really really loved gil ra im style and it definitely an inspiration to what want to wear just loved how m really sensitive to people who work menial jobs like cashiers janitors waitresses etc just feel like they have to deal not only so many demands but the thing hate the most entitlement today couldn stop crying am really really really sensitive person so crying isn alien to me but haven cried like this in the longest time you know when you just want to stop crying agree with all of the above except for the fact that actually get excited with the pop culture questions because growing up we babysat ourselves with the tv and mass media so m quite know exactly how you feel get criticism and negativity from my mom and she the only person want to hear approval from even though now really try to detach myself from her feel so guilty love absurd comedy like mr bean and monk anyone with me actually care lot about the clothes wear but not because want to impress anyone but want to impress myself however my number one rule is that it has to be cheap and not over 30 bucks and the thing is two infps can still be as wildly different as you can imagine know one infp met in highschool and he just made me feel like would never belong to his exclusivity didn want to those are lot of questions and m feeling lazy for which apologize for so ll tell you what consider my sense of accomplishment it actually really easy it whenever feel empowered not trying to be argumentative but don see any contextual evidence that points to her being an enfp think though certainly the movie is very very infpish the film is not so much about being lol not chick film at all it too serene to be overly sentimental romantic was just about to say the same thing even though she seems extroverted pay attention to the fact that she is actually often solitary in the entire movie and that she has one best friend also do this all the time with the right personalities they think m hilarious but have gotten some concerned reactions like one time don know what beckoned me to say this but someone asked was looking about through 10 pages before just gave up on reading the rest xd it interesting to see how causal sex violates values lot of you guys have it doesn do that for me at m only student so can give you the teacher perspective but as teacher honestly there are going to be kids who will never like you just because you re teacher and they re student honestly m not an animal lover at all actually get annoyed when people talk about their pets or even have pets it might break everyone heart to read this but just don care fwi grew ve read through all the replies through here before posting this but even then this is just my singular opinion and not necessarily response to what anyone has said like lana del rey the person above me just posted the sexiest gif everrr had this problem too because my extroversion and introversion are really really really close it pretty much your default response to whether you recharge your batteries by being yourself and feel really dumb that ll probably fail college biology and that my gpa was 4 0 last semester and after this semester will be like 2 9 3 2 know academic mediocrity isn the end of you know what like about everyone pictures is that they have personality can really tell you guys have whole inner world in your eyes and the way you smile or don smile get excited oh yeah actually have really nice pell grant and because my community college is cheap don have to pay anything know as college student in america am really really really really 1 what do you think you have to offer someone else m very independent but very affectionate so think could totally give someone both the space and affirmation they need m really funny so m actually really frugal and sensible with my money keep in mind am in big family of s but god do love buying dvds and books off amazon and essential oils off ebay so to my fam they ahhhh feel ya was in similar situation in life and funny my parents were like that too read somewhere might have been on this forum actually that infp kids might have developed because kind of do can handle any extroversion thinking or judging aspect as long as it doesn have an in the middle of it sorry estj and istj lol the problem have with overly sensory we were young and having our own inferiority complexes low self esteems but moreso avoiding the mj which is perhaps why our paths haven met until now but seriously think as kid these both were going to be my answers if hadn chosen resilience and entitlement totally feel ya think that empathy is even deeper than compassion feel compassion has this detached air my introversion and extroversion are really close and so if want to be extroverted am complete enfp have an enfp friend and what love about him is that he just guides the conversation to omg yes this is my family my mom literally told me to go kill myself if was really that stressed it was just said so flippantly like was exasperating her by sharing my feelings and oh ah ve been there know how it feels like when you see yourself as completely different so that when people give you compliments even though you know they re sincere you don feel like they re thank you so much really appreciate it what is the one quality you admire most in person resilience love people who refuse to be anchored by their problems who use the intensity of the negativity that surrounds them to be sometimes feel like ll never get out of this house even though m completely headstrong and adamant about doing so m sick of being angry and annoyed at my family and like have to do so much if it wasn for the fact that most people use facebook literally would not use it ever just feel like

feels silly to talk about since totally don give shit but met owen and luke wilson at nightclub in dallas met and hung out with for hours actually gary buscey at yeah m seven that probably why miss thang likes to hide just read your deal and m not claiming the intensity of love is just based in whatever they re coining as romantic love think an sx loves differently and it stronger than some temporary you really should never claim certainty for what someone else feels don think sx ness is the norm it probably sort of rare all sorts of spiritual ethical or humanitarian types of things you and yours edit haha iphone typo haha fixed ya know totally do but honestly haven seen her in awhile she sits mute and disappointed that no one wants to amuse her lately yes for sure im very and have hard time staying in the moment unless its full of passion the biggest turn on for me is the feeling of both of us needing each other like right fucking and was married for 13 years know what romantic love entails and no it doesn just last year but thanks for the attempt to school me haha in the eneagram the instinctual stackings sx sp so ya know um m an enfp think got it haha road trip with few friends or maybe going out to comedy club or an amusement park or sleepover like bunch of 16 yr olds just something different with lots if laughs preferable cocktails fuck no what an odd random question money is one of those worldy things that don factor at all to me money has no power to influence my feelings towards someone yes it does thank you for noticing haha its like feeling you re always caring more about everyone else than they do you like it will wreck your whole world if they re no longer apart of it know just cannot comprehend someone saying they love you when it not this way what is that kind of love it seems empty like lie ve found that this is the single most difficult aspect of my relationships as an sx my love is transcendent deeper and more powerful than any bs worldy thing seem to keep ending up in funny so many mentioned twinkly eyes ve been told have them my whole life weird mean just the very idea of it is weird it just some inner expressiveness of how we re feeling think hastily haha no idk think things to death an explore every possible outcome or side and then hesitate think it to death some more but if m pressed just pick something and hope yeah you do sound like an enfp don talk to everyone all the time at all either can be just fine not talking to people at all only say things when feel like it your thread is sooooo nfp i confused how does it work with an sx with an so im working on it but yeah to be very well paid photographer that only works about 1 day week and goes to awesome locations for destination weddings too would like to travel lot more are you kidding me how could you not cry at that not just lil soft tears it completely wrecked me was big blubbering mess almost everytime ve become instant friends with someone they ve turned out to be enfp adore the ones ve known m totally committed to improving my life and relationships with people this year want to keep in contact with my friends that moved away from and make some new ones here plan on creating think that sort of concern is in the realm of so which am not my bf is and concerns himself with such things often know that can be awkward and have on occasion embarrassed myself bit didn watch the whole thing but watched long enough to form an opinion haha think enfp definitely not infp would buy istj before infp istjs are way too secure in their competency to you don get married because you think it fits your life plan you don get married because he a good guy you get married because you never want to be with anyone else because you can not sure how well those who ve posted understand enfps enfps don care enough to ask this sort of question are you serious we change friends every couple months wtbh im an enfp was thinking of posting this thread

              " ' yes they are one of my weakness types so fun and full of life have more close enfj friends and have always gotten along with that type m 22 and have noticed this bad behavioral pattern ve been developing have tendency to get attached to guy friends and develop feelings for them after while after that can get them out used to be scared of needles and vaccines too but got over that get the comparison you are making but to me it just in completely different category when you go get vaccine you can it could have something to do with my sex drive sure but ve been this way all my life and don just have problem with romantic touch but also the platonic kind yeah m from culture and family where we are not physically affectionate at all my mom was good mom and took care of us but there was never that kind of hug and kiss thing happening in our 22 and maybe about two years ago why do admit these things sound cliche but hopeless romantic does unfortunately describe who am yolo is just dumb word to say do spontaneous crazy things and live wild in shorter way don mean to make it sound like he would just be willing to drop everything and date and commit for life just mean know there is connection between us and know he is physically don have history of sexual or physical abuse if that what you mean don have any other particularly traumatic events in my life either apart from the classic daddy issues and being to me this sounds bit like you are asexual nothing wrong with that have felt sexual attraction to people before and do think could get into sex if got over my fear or letting people down don know there are so many labels and reasons probably but just want to fix it rather than over analyze it more this is actually such an interesting perspective it is so different from mine but totally get where you are coming from logically and morally sex isn wrong it natural and think girls who thank you for your thoughtful response it nice to feel that someone really gets it the basic textbook advice is always just don do anything before you are perfectly ready and the right person it complicated we are classmates and became friends we hang out daily on friend group of around 4 8 people know he was into me in the beginning don want to sound conceded lol but is that sarcasm lol i think many infjs have this ability to hang out with pretty much anyone m not judgemental and can get along with most people easily hang can hang out with party drug crowd one day and then agree with this love sun but rainy day once in while feels so calming and refreshing can listen to different kind of music then and it more socially acceptable to be sitting in with i be interested in hearing how other infjs express anger and frustration does it happen often or rarely and in what kind of situations can add my response later in too but don wanna can relate get feelings towards people who are either emotionally unavailable or someone could never actually date housemate teacher friend boyfriend etc think it a self defense artistic loving and caring but also bit selfish and naive sorry i thought was an infp at one point briefly but then realized that really wasn d yeah agree appreciate you saying that m just sometimes tired of being such an hopeless romantic and over analyzer or every potential relationship want to just learn to go with it and hate my ni feel that it honestly makes me so disconnected from the world and people most times yeah sure it great to see things from many perspectives and understand things on deep level know that logically but ve been alone my whole life and avoiding any possibility of intimacy or sex because ve had that attitude m trying to develop as human and not be so stuck in this what does this mean exactly do you have to have the same level of libido and be into the same things or so you have an open relationship could imagine being okay with something like that maybe at one point honestly how can girl be soooo bad at sex that it be deal breaker want details is it because they are too shy or boring or not willing to do certain stuff the problem is that don think could have sex with someone without romantic connection know that is how life should be in the ideal world and haven done anything with anyone because am looking for person who really would get it and be okay with it but m also trying to be yeah feel you feel ve missed out on few potential romantic relationships in my life since knew the other person had sexually active fast and would feel pressure to put out so my that is honestly what feel like m gonna be like my biggest fear when it comes to sex is disappointing or boring someone because m so shy and not into super wild stuff kind of don care as gives me some hope guess but also don want to force someone to wait for me and miss out on living their best sexual life so it complicated m kind of afraid of the words meaning action aspect of an estp if told an estp had feelings for them and they felt the same way they would probably just see it as the next logical step to hook haha yeah if m at party or something and someone just randomly puts their arm around me or grabs my hand just kind of like freeze and try to get out of it as fast as can without seeming maybe there hope for me yet how soon do you start to get sexual in new relationships with partner if may ask ve been trying to do that and honestly have made huge personal improvements on some stuff like hugging and platonic friendly touching it so funny though that m still at level of 13 year it really does depend on the person and situation lot for me too if like someone enough am okay with them being physically close and even sleeping in the same bed just don want it to get don want pity pass don want to bore anyone or suck at it i an infj and 4w5 nice to meet you had relatively good childhood but grew up in family of thinkers that always made me feel like was the black sheep and there was something wrong actually ve never had sex at all the idea of being so shit at it that someone would just give up on you is pretty horrible tbh if you care about the person can one bad first sexual experience no you re welcome to join in too just am mostly confused about the estps and their views on sex m nearly 23 and as long as can remember ve had problems with physical intimacy and expressing emotions through physical contact don just mean in sexual or romantic way ve even been for me it not about morality or some kind of societal values just don feel comfortable getting physical right away want to know the person and have connection first and kind of feel you re an intj though that very different from an estp perspective how could girl be so bad at sex that you give up after the first time yaiks i don judge other people for having sex casually but for me need to have some kind of connection or trust before this is actually very accurate he takes it pretty hard when people close to him are disappointed in his actions like he will try to make it up to me if he feels he messed up something before m this actually makes lot of sense he doesn really care about what random people think unlike me care way way too much but he seems to care lot about disappointing people close to him how long are you willing to wait to have sex or get more physical in new relationship do you see sex as just standard thing that you jump into pretty much right away how important is sexual no he definitely is estps have extroverted feeling as their third function and can see his sensitive side though he tries to hide it he would never tell this stuff to just anyone but m very have close estp friend and he is the sweetest and kindest person know however ve noticed he is often paranoid about people not liking him even though they really do he is always the life ',\n",
              " ' someone who knows what the definition of reciprocity is someone who can look past my flaws someone kind that wants to build life with me and my kind of pretty you know what sucks when particular close friend tells me that don appreciate her as friend and feeling like don feel like they re being good enough ve shown time and time again how we re here somewhere me personally ve been living like thoreau did back in walden pond except not in the woods and having internet connection so really not exactly like thoreau did meh after posted had emailed the same question to two of my mates in wales and in london the londoner texted me back saying that one of the major reasons why is that so few writers 1 2 usually ugh wanted to post doctor who question but since someone already beat me to it here goes another one love british television but why oh why are their series always either 6 episodes 1 in an intimate relationship d like to spend as much time as humanly possible with her having said that d still like for us to have our lives separate from each other to do the things we lol in my earlier years was someone people would come to vent to ask an opinion or just have someone to listen to just got it my friends would say there really is lot to learn dear infj out in virginia you have become an important person in my life it saddens me that we can progress into something more than friends for now you know the kind of man am and in mine is normal think often times because have soft voice am asked to speak up it unpleasant because it sounds like m yelling inside my head it a sharp contrast to my normal couple of things is that effie from skins in your avatar and that creepy guy from buzzfeed is awesome what is dumb way you ve hurt yourself touching the barrel of recently fired weapon those things are hot what noise annoys you specifically this guy with harley in my neighborhood can attest to this my personal experience in dealing with depression and ptsd had to really have myself broken down before could begin to work on getting through the trauma and healing a little bit of both really in the military we were taught to have situational awareness it came natural to me because ve always observed my surroundings whether m aware of it or not hate that have an over active brain that seems to be working at light speeds regardless of how busy m keeping myself thoughts are an endless current with no ebb or flow it not even you rock the short hair very well ah no worries glad that you were able to get over it were they friends or family of yours it unfortunate that they would joke about you re being quiet especially since you said they knew why you have yet to find your voice it great that you forgot to mention jebediah and myexplodingcat in my you re welcome post newb that am ve been doing that my whole life it seems didn realize it is an infj quality don remember which exorcist it was possibly the first but m not sure nowadays but there is one scene from the movies that led to me fearing hallways for very long time they were at the would you like to talk about them thank you for that it amazing how simple words from stranger can mean lot same boat as you maybe struggling in different ways but struggling nonetheless ve been away awhile but just wanted to say you re welcome understandable personally don care much for his private habits he a good actor who has played some interesting roles also he part of this site called hitrecord which has been good not sure if this belongs in this thread but didn know where else to post it but here goes how do you feel about aldon smith 9 game suspension was it too harsh or not enough personally yeah think lot of them are projecting their own inner demons as way to make themselves feel better guess where m coming from the guy friends used to have would never question why an damnit mr cafebot where was my awesome greeting was born into roman catholic family but rejected it when started getting serious about science since then ve tip toed the line between atheism and agnosticism but now just consider it going to get serious so apologize in advance to my best friend wish you could have came to me before you did what you did maybe you did and just didn realize it forgive my 13 having spent the last couple of years weeding out unessential people in my life find that only have handful of people can be around ve gone most of this summer not socializing other would ask him why he did what he did and not come to me for help 19 years later and still miss the guy used to be so enamored with european women it was the accents mostly having spent good amount of time in europe felt like was in heaven being surrounded by all these women with wonderful have so much to learn m completely lost by everything you guys are talking about but that will come in time the girl m currently interested in is also an infj she probably the only ve never cared for societal pressure being 32 year old single male most of my high school friends are married with children or have so my situation has always been difficult because the oooh do tell what happened with you and

boat as you so hopefully you ll meet some interesting and wonderful people infj here ve never seen treasure planet but probably would if did watch it quick browse on wiki tells me joseph gordon levitt voices the main character and he my man crush but yeah if you re apprehensive about being an officer you can enlist and come out of basic with an 4 pay grade it not much but it still beats being lowly

between fifa 13 and football manager 14 madden came out recently so ll pick that up soon ish eventually heya siennao thanks for replying on my little thread anyway as m still learning about my infj

              " ' ve always been attracted to introverted guys had one bf and either we were always competing or turned inward he was not one who could seem to turn inward at all he derived all sense of agree with all that kerry wrote and wanted to add that it obviously depends on who we give our love to some folks can accept our enfp love and reciprocate others can not and that when it hurts in my case it was thoroughly sub conscious would never consciously change myself just to please another in fact can respect people pleasers unless they are trying to fight that need and are definitely think this is my responsibility and while have mixed feelings about the guy wrote about it imperative that learn how to not lose myself with anyone the steps you outlined have yes ve been wondering where you were saw what was at least infatuation with my intx and it certainly seemed to have him distracted from everything else is there ever good reason for m not sure how this turned into thread on one night stands this guy and were friends for year before we even kissed it hurts tremendously to lose friend in this way he too welcome and second closet query about your travels prefer robin williams as an example of an enfp male will smith strikes me as superficial and that type of person but ll admit especially the men irritate me to no end williams has the depth m encouraged by these statements because feel similarly ve found that certain groups of friends see me one way and another will perceive me in the almost an opposite way yes that moment was sad albeit illuminating realized he always revert to his way of self preservation which find destructive despite everything we went through together thanks and just to clarify we had been friends for about year before it became physical ve considered this but don know how would feel about it before it became such an issue really enjoyed the physical intimacy but now it certainly is an issue not sure where to go from few nights ago said thought we needed to take break unfortunately it did come up when he was already irritated with me but felt had to say it that night because was either going to ha when was teen think my rage and it was rage over being broken up with was so intense probably had psychotic break shocked dry and unfortunately did get rep for being kinda oops just saw this out of curiosity what did you read that swayed you what are the benefits of an enfp to you can see why an intp would like an enfp but m not so sure what the female enfp would get out of it except some thoughtful conversation while really flirting can be friendliness and even have hard time explaining this while it seems absurd to most other types ve never really known the difference between being friendly and flirting welcome m most likely an enfp but relate strongly to the side too so ll be interested to see how your experience here develops this would not have readily occurred to me but upon reflection think you have point about us know that if someone accuses me of being insensitive and it early in the relationship do get while m sure she does like you make sure not to misread her friendliness for more at this time without wanting to some enfps especially female think give others the impression that they are welcome fellow enfp just joined and have found the folks her have lot of info and insight to share have fun learning happy as far as biographies go one of the best ve read is of american poet anne sexton by diane middlebrook dwm com books anne sexton biography another good book about sexton is anne can somebody elaborate on these differences for me yes this is exactly what is happening there is an unconscious drain ve found that many people in my life become attracted to me because have an energy to me which others especially the m an enfp who has been dating an intx some of you may have read my post about how to handle the relationship on infj forum spent some time with him this weekend but kept it brief just one like bluntness albeit with some good nf laughing padding yes agree that m being hypervigilant and therefore it hard to fully be in the moment he may also be thinking about the edited to be less wordy and hopefully bit more pg few days ago my sex partner couldn ciimax and became very cold and distant very fast soon after that was dumb and seeked an apology had an eye opening experience with him within the past 24 hours ll elaborate in another post when have more time but in all honesty don think he ll interpret what do however chose to thank you for the link on the few tests ve taken always score as 3 or 6 ahh feels good in my balanced enfp skin huh read about enfj and also my stand by enfp and that site description of an enfp is me in these respects have been told have this uncanny explain will check it out just read that profile and while m sure m not can see why you think that based on what ve posted it is important to me that explain care for this intx while have no idea how strangely it our time together if private because he extremely tense in pubic places that is almost painfully sincere don mean sex but all of our time it the disagreements that have quoted more than what d wanted specifically this is what resonated with me interesting that you mentioned because have suspected he could be that too he is all about the details and he got irritated with me when asked what it had become and shut down since m quite unsure about what can handle m refraining from labeling it don want to lobby for girlfriend status if we are probably too early in the physical relationship to define it as more d probably refer to it as dating we don talk about the future it very much in the present which like thanks for these links they explain lot so far know m fe note posted this on the intp forum but many there suggested my friend may indeed be an intj based on what ve read of each type he certainly does seem to have more traits such as being some saw my intro thread so ll try to elaborate bit identify with but need lot of time alone m good with people when m not too nervous and have been dealing with that with what andrea it hadn occurred to me to identify with type d never scored as but m actually encouraged not confused by your information so thanks of course the fact that you re an intp makes ah thank you very informative and an insightful explanation so what may refer to as enthusiasm or charisma may strike some types as manipulative realize that may be oversimplifying but thanks starry from the brief time ve spent studying mbti agree with you about not spending so much time finding my exact type but more about learning how to identify and utilize my while reading about enfjs came upon lot about manipulative enfjs what behavior leads to this stereotype are others misunderstanding the enfj motives well know lot depends upon the situation may be naturally outgoing but certain types of social interaction stress me out so much ll do most anything to avoid them or while m passionate thanks to everybody for all the replies and the socionics links were interesting now to figure out the difference between socionics and mbti do think am fairly well balanced because ve thanks of course based on my most recent mbti test m far more than is there any info on how trauma may affect one mbti result think m naturally j but sometimes fear or anxiety put ve taken mbti tests on similar minds and just now on mypersonality have tested as enfp infp entp and entj how can find more specific questions to find my type know that enfj fits me ',\n",

working on the report thanks so much for those of you who hey everyone m really getting desperate for people to take this survey the project due date has been bumped up and need more people now than did before please if you happen upon this well d probably guess that you changed how you refer to that object after being around people who referred to it differently meaning they might have influenced the kind of language you use it thanks you guys appreciate this nasmoe haha that very interesting the funny thing is after taking this class may know the reason why individual language evolves like that thanks okay so far ve got 8 people need at least 20 more thanks appreciate you taking the time to do this for me hi everyone have an anonymous survey here that need at least thirty

was very connected with his students and by that mean me guess while still keeping thanks for the replies they were all incredibly insightful and gave me alot of hope unfortunately m still feeling this depersonalization derealization and started this thread two m sure this has happened to some of you just find it out of place considering the infp is supposed to have high sense of self think ve lost my sense of self and consequentially ended conversation with friend of the male variety few minutes ago this friend used to be in love with me but was not aware of how deeply until recently until he started dating someone 1 what are your initials i 2 country you live uhmericuh 3 age 17 4 girl or boy very calm almost euphoric not exactly though there a hint of yearning and sadness that m

with me this rarely happens during the good don want to read your posts anymore just don buy into this idea that you have to be bastard if you want to attract mate only need one girl so d rather keep

have those aren female qualities empathy has nothing to do with being female stop being informed by old fashioned bee hive confused sounds great cool aha you don proud whereabouts in the uk are you

can do would you be willing to shave your legs and put on dress apparently m suave which means you should definitely date me the suave lover 50 partner focus 52 aggressiveness 35 adventurousness humps your nostril hairs proud crazy shocked jolly good show tongue yep we ve all got fucked up histories take no personal responsibility for colonialism though proud yes well m consequentialist so think that if break is what it takes then that what you should do m not an really activist myself just discuss things don really do think might like to live there but worry that there something bit selfish about going off to live in commune when you could be trying to spread socialist practices nationwide oh yeah of course ve been single for nearly 23 years and it getting bit silly so am now scouring the internet for girl this thread is only newest part of my search haven i not sure can elaborate off the top of my head it normally starts with debate about something quite specific which goes on and on and on until it becomes clear to my friend that my opinion well keep talking to me and you ll soon realise that there definitely isn an in my type wink how old is ungs anyway aren elves immortal well harbour hopes for some kind of socialist utopia cynical people get pissed off by that sort of never actually finished reading lotr blushed cool where will you study no they re always throwing wet blankets over my ideas to be honest have no idea know very little about finland theoretical my thesis will be about the objectivity of aesthetic values yes ma am proud they aren remotely cynical and they seem to have the ability to see right through m into rut and my mind is occupied by getting out of it enfps and intjs aren opposite no enfps and intjs supposedly go well together that why m here and went to the enfj place because some other test told me to have no reason to think that the infjs would suit me so that not real is it mellow am in need of romantic attachment am 22 year old heterosexual manboy who lives in england m doing phd in philosophy date me please wink or if you live far far away which you not single enfj has commented on this thread think d better hassle the enfps instead probably prefer them in practice what confused you re an intp how come that message wasn a thousand times longer tongue balancing morality and love who would want to do that maybe this is very bad but think d be capable of doing terrible things in the name of love that creepy why do you have photograph of me well think there hope for me ve observed that happening between friends of mine and find myself relating to the rationalist but siding with the person whose feelings are not being taken well you haven stopped talking to me so hopefully m managing to cross that bridge so far oh m socially inept there no denying it that why m in an internet forum instead of okay shexy blushed nope can flirt oh you re both here freaky can remember how found this site think must have googled enfj think jumping in at the deep end could work for me can cope with conflict so where were you expecting to see similarities wink took some test that told me that my ideal woman is an enfj so have come here to see if can find one thought might as well make my intentions explicit and see what happens one tries to live off teaching wages and research grants the ultimate aim is to get permanent teaching post at university and write books and articles on the side something like that d infjs what are they like actually tend to find introverts incredibly attractive but m pretty shy so could do with someone to scoop me out of my shell ',\n",
              " ' actually didn want to admit it but was drunk when wrote my first post ve killed part of me in response don worry maybe you do have good understanding of but really she has after reading my post can see many mistakes so let me try and rephrase apologies for the inconsideration put to my words amazingly so in fact jumped the gun on everything said rest curious who is from us and who is from uk different societies and all that can relate to certain mentalities to understand little better either way who is moving where and for what ve debated this for long time m from england and ve generally despised lot of people that thought were estp however ve been living in japan for the past 8 months and m now dating if you re worried give her little more time then just ask and give her date you re free try not to hesitate about getting what you want they also have the same right and if they wanna either or sounds like he has very well balanced f understands and appreciates both side of the coin in that respect wouldn worry beyond that actually he sounds like someone d want to m glad you noticed although probably easily the fact that he hugs you little tighter and puts his head close he probably just doesn have the words the explain his feelings on it to me the love her insults me upsets me and will not stop doing what she wants to do unless there something to make her think otherwise she incredibly nice to people even though think it hurts her yep it has seemed to me to be my life goal for few years dream to have children the reason keep reaching is to be able to show someone world in which they can ultimately control want cannabis is not health problem the problem is that it promotes social values and attitudes which are unwelcome in capitalist based society beg you to watch the video whilst listening to if you re comfortable being alone for long amount of time then there no problem most of my social interaction comes from work school after these just want to go home and chill maybe with honestly sometimes think the enneagram is better source of information for dealing with people however it seems to me like you re the one trying out all the new strategies to keep the peace don care about the shit that is accept that shit defend you re right to take control of that shit so that you can then enjoy whatever the hell you want to enjoy don get pushed around and think there a reason to be concerned how can an 18 year old know the true effects of such possible probable life changing experience at young age m not saying an 18 year old can think m dating an estp girl it a blast she healthy with good sense of everything except me she just knows m kind and care about her very much d only fault her on the fact that she really m pretty sure m type 4 did read few type 9 articles that resonated with me but never to the extent that most type 4 articles do m also in agreement about the creativity aspects just haha honestly that kind of what thought it went down treat oh the puns m studying in fukuoka at seinan gakuin what about you dig little deeper learn who they are and what they like only shy people dislike questions and m fairly sure that estp aren shy they would happily answer your questions m sure m have crazy theory on the link between cannabis and food honestly think that weed smokers always know it the weed making them want to eat all the crap in their fridge and because they know was japanese school girl the outfit was my girlfriends and am currently studying abroad in japan mention this because normally hate the idea of dressing up at halloween but this years hesher hesher is loner he hates the world and everyone in it he has long greasy hair and homemade tattoos he is malnourished and smokes lot of cigarettes he likes fire and blowing things don trust myself with it because ve gotten it wrong few times just like everyone else although m great at spotting if one person fancies another but if the spot light is on me m my best friend is an estj he a very socially anxious person which think helped bring us together when we were younger dunno man but tom waits is awesome and you ve just given me song that ll try not to forget cheers two very interesting articles thanks for sharing it doesn really bother me can emphasise with the people that share the same interests and

of various types that might like dislike you however political correctness aside if we are generalising think theoretically an intj with tolerance of extraversion bullying is real problem only people who have experienced it cruelty and maliciousness know full well how painful it can be it should not be treated as run of the mill sort of first of all welcome to perc second of all if you are an infp your dominant function would be fi there is no greater sensitive function than this one it won just look at what the definitely not affectionate the in fi is directed inward bit by bit ll open up with few close circle of people care about even then an arms length is just fine as boundaries are unhealthy maybe these guys are introverted too and by the following rationale they are equally unlikely to make move istp this is proof of this this was part of his interview with that muslim journalist from what saw the journalist actually did better than his other religious contemporaries although entj no seriously probably xsfp this has probably been done before but couldn be bothered to fish it out so richard dawkins what type is he propose intx of that much feel certain not sure about j troll amongst trolls but there is stuff that pisses you off about every type so no to clingy yes to thinking lot about them blasted fi overly important well yeah if m dating them but no to putting them on pedestal or ignoring their flaws and seeing what intp istp he doesn like to talk much and is definitely solitary so could be istp they tend to be men of few words but then again he did all that hacker shit before he signed on with this right here this is what believe contributes to laziness not completely but largely because if you lack aptitude in certain area then you can and it like what someone else definitely not attracted to entj in the romantic sense the polarization of this pair is way to draining not because they steam roll but it takes way too much damn effort to bridge the gap esfp the star wars prequels are better than the sequels suck it bitches hello hello hello welcome to perc wink this is just bullshit conjecture go ahead put it to vote your estimated type definitely won

his friends come over and they gamble and drink besides most of the time he out and being social when he getting laid so he doesn need to spend any donkeybals and outofplace thanks for your responses m wandering whether to spend more time in la or florida it basically between disneyland and universal studios la or disneyworld and what are the best theme parks to visit in the s please specify which state as well for me best means in terms of thrills but want this to be broad so in your opinion which is the oh ve heard of anti social personality disorder the only reason bring the two up is amongst those in prison diagnosed with aspd there are some whose mri scans show neurological yes given that sociopathy is more product of nurture whereas psychopathy is more product of nature imagine an who has been abused and neglected their entire life leaving them ultimately this pisses me off the fact that he was puppet without mind of his own it took away from his intimidation and reduced him to an obedient mutt you have all this admiration for his think se does play role in how good one hand eye coordination is obviously there are exceptions m intuitive and my hand eye is pretty good although nothing special and conversely your an estp hows your hand eye coordination do you think it has anything to do with se very odd indeed to go to such lengths to meet up when people fly off the handle when geographically close exes meet up sense an ulterior motive not to say he will try for sexual contact they needn be friends or family for you to mourn their loss empathy in general is part of the human condition therefore there is nothing selfish about feeling saddened by the loss of life wouldn classify it as preying it not like stand from afar eyes gazing with malevolent intent crazy

the examples of scenarios you gave ve done bit of that but could do more his situation is the they are sorting through masses of applications many of which look the same if you had two candidates who look the same on paper except one was was convicted of molesting donkeys who would you that rounds out the picture nicely it not an exact science diagnosing mbti type from forum posts but in this case everything points to entj m looking for some advice on how to help an entj develop his leadership presence am the manager of an entj at present he has no formal authority over anyone else he is really nice the parts about bragging on facebook bouncing ideas off people and wanting to be an international playboy point toward extroversion as does your focus on practical things ni doms intj and because years of experience means squat except that you ve lived long enough to acquire it m not fond of years of experience measures because of all the lazy fools who sit on their ass for 20 being on the border between intp and intj is kind of like being on the border between switzerland and peru they both have mountains and snow but are not remotely on the same continent haven noticed that anger is an emotion frequently expressed by entjs annoyance on the other hand 1 istj solid trustworthy will keep things humming along the way they have been except probably more efficiently 2 entj very serious and responsible the only other type that gets me the details you posted make very clear he is into you and not just as friend don believe in home wreckers how you follow up on his interest is your responsibility not his he not m very frustrated that the public policy issue gets confused with the procedure itself almost every single time the procedure is medical issue and whether to avail oneself of it an individual promotion is just an example schools have all sorts of benefits that get fought over viciously there some kind of politics going on that about all anyone can say without more details entjs it really has more to do with the context than type entj says m going to do insert big ambitious plans here entp thinks crap m going to have to really up my game or entj is going to maybe m paranoid but when someone tells an intj to be yourself interpret that to mean they see the intj persona to be some weird act and they want you to manifest the normal personality they dear istj team members your hard work detail orientation reliability and low drama never cease to amaze me m very lucky that get to work with you sincerely your intj boss both including living with an infp for 22 years the thing is an type can address relationship issue in their way and it will sail right over the head of t type as we will interpret the this part is very intp the first two sentences show fe which encourages sacrifice for the good of the community fi on the other hand focuses on the individual not humanity and coercion of you were apparently perplexed by an introvert not wanting to address relationship issues but some types of introverts don avoid addressing those issues in the same way an entj would an intj when was younger sought the advice of older people when available it wasn because they were older but because they were more experienced the opportunities were limited however as they yeah the op issue may be more of t issue than an i issue depends on the introvert very much deal with things externally if they matter when have time to collect my thoughts and evidence m very outspoken and persistent may stay in my yeah this is what totally freaked me out initially especially when got some people straight out of college who were totally awesome human beings but also pretty much helpless without significant there is an incredible amount of mba bs speak going on in large corporations the organization is not the individual friend but their manager needs to be as manager in very large it the only type like better when they re being assholes the way they are so earnest about it is endearing was in similar situation rather recently and it really helped to get some normality back dealing with someone with mental illness 24 7 can really mess you up in my case someone confided some young intjs are romantic however this guy is 28 and by then the world has usually beaten harder reality into you your perspective seems little skewed as well his dream job versus sounds like you were trying to do the best thing instead of what those who have the power of hiring and firing think is the best thing totally entjs are famous for being docile little rule followers and policy lovers you already know the problem she has crush on you and the stress of her ni fueled fantasies not matching up to reality is bringing out an underdeveloped and inexperienced fi say goodbye there good news face it intjs are way too blunt abrasive and obnoxious to seek relationship advice from all you nf and sp ladies out there desperately poring over your intj guy texts for clues the think quick and act quicker thing isn very intj or entj you seem pretty clearly entp actually two things are really blazingly obvious here ni dom and utter lack of fe hence intj can imagine any actual entj describing themselves as clingy there an epic thread on neutrality',\n",

extravertedsensingfeelingperceivingstrength of the preferences 89317567 no and wouldn because simply there a ridiculously small chance of winning anything significant with the number of tickets you end up buying before you won something it really not worth my brother istp was awful for this when he was younger he seemed to love getting rise out of me and knew exactly what buttons to press he knows how highly value my privacy and personal my mum is an estp father would guess is an istj don have as much contact with him am an intj and my brother is an istp only correlation seem to get is we re all types have an know this is just speculation and generalisation because types are so diverse etc oh well time for my input d immediately be inclined to say istj though have nothing to back do enjoy art but don make time for it anymore like used to think like it because like trying to show the things imagine in my mind lot of the time ll picture incredibly types in general ve never really known many of them well and my family all seem to be either very strong types or feel that emotions are weakness don take this the wrong way but can see why he thinks you re being rude we re not comfortable with complete spontaniety but guess he could have planned it and not told you in advance if he if like someone lot want to be around them and spend time with them don like physical touch at all and find it difficult to express myself in words when feel strong emotions m very much thinker and show emotion because can control it always wished could just hide everything and put up facade but don seem to work like that all of the time in general my mum xstx is all can figure out always asked my opinion when she wanted to decorate room d end up suggesting perhaps couple of bold colours which think look nice together or just it would be worse to be considered manipulative rather than selfish because selfishness doesn intentionally seek to use harm others it is solely the act of doing what will benefit oneself live in house of five at university now often end up going for the whole weekend without decent conversation and it even annoys me of all people however don get along with my ve had to do one before but since m only 19 it was for part time job alongside my studies which wasn all that concerned with answered honestly but like you m pretty sure they were sometimes it better to be concise maybe they want to encourage that also my skeptical side says they just don want to be sat reading loads of extra pages and as said by others it i tend to get these moments where suddenly feel motivated to work and then find when start often get really into what m doing and can study for quite while if it an interesting topic when you find yourself in pub with friends and it 11pm and they want to go to another bar you go home because you have 9am class the next day and don want to risk being late for it you whilst generally don forget to do such things do lose any interest in eating if m stressed if m really focused on something resent having to get up and stop what m doing to go to hate it live in house now with four other first year university students the situation evolved so that the two most extroverted houesmates live practically as mini family and do most hated question demand of all time so tell me about yourself makes me want to implode what do say what are they wanting to know how do not sound like total idiot nerd so many just hate it when some extroverts because lot aren like this are completely ignorant of the existence of introverts said extroverts don think twice about invading my personal space going the future definately you can learn about the past through books at least but the future is completely unknown d be so excited to see all the new technology and developments which would be know people with over 1000 facebook friends have 96 all of them are people know and like and have or have previously had fair amount of contact with mostly consists of people from because it pretty much guranteed ll find some people expressing thoughts opinions and ideas that can agree with or relate to that doesn seem to happen in my normal everyday life like m in the uk it quite different system to the us go to the university of leeds which is massive place and it offers lots of majors though is academic in comparison to leeds metropolitan this universitising bothers me m in university now my first year actually and have been extremely dissapointed in some aspects since was quite young guess romanticised the idea of get stressed over the tiniest things yet find it strange that the things that stress me out other people seem to see as petty yet other people get stressed over things think are incredibly don and find it extremely annoying when people do the worst person for it is my mother estp who never stops talking to herself and can tell if she talking to herself or trying to do all of those lol the whispering one is very rare occurence saved for my math teacher who patronises us just shut up please favourites geography closely followed by maths and physics least favourites sport nothing comes close also disliked history and things like drama and music because they seemed pointless do it all the time hate nothing more than when obviously don want to talk about it and people keep pressing the issue and get annoyed at me for not telling them what bothering me feel the that illogical variant couldn be more true of myself sounds like my brother d say he an xstp but don think that very much related to his obsessive computer tv use m slightly more chaotic than typical my desk currently has empty cans of pop all over it and some papers for school my actual computer desktop is picture of band like and have mother estp younger brother xstp can tell if he introverted or just failed extrovert me intj father ixtj don know him that well but it the best guess can make my mum and the idea of doing any sort of mind altering substance scares the heck out of me hate the thought of losing my inhibitions need to feel in control of myself all the time and yes m also as an intj ve been described as either chaotic neutral or neutral evil as well as true neutral identify with all three but most strongly with chaotic neutral have huge dislike for sports just don get it the atmosphere team playing competitiveness it just does nothing for me if m going to be active go to the gym or go on bike ugh hate phones only reason have one is to keep in touch with people if need them and because it be weird for 17 year old not to have one my esxp mother words it probably uh hey as an intj don like talking about myself and all the little details so ll just say that m chaz m 17 and act middle aged

at all for us we love romance but it might be uncomfertable if you start to expect certain things that a you should watch røyksopp and todd terje live shows they are really cool and does exactly what you say 4sure but techno is very different from edm lol you guys are funny 3 lol well if it were not for you enfp we have time to write emo songs about real problems instead xd 3 if you are looking for deepness you should stay far away from this type of random non trustworthy marginalization idunno man what if this infp baby is really hard to understand and is all reserved passive agressive and essentric easier if it an energetic baby who acts how he feels even if its way more maybe connect fast yeah but takes while to truly know us lalz while you are just talking and talking all the time

to make him met an enfp today who actually loved techno even minimal she didnt know what it was untill showed her tho so then it 1 against 5 guess you are wrong the first one is from the worlds most acknowledged female techno producer and dj granted there is techno that is way more minimal than her material but posted hers because it is thanks 3 but m here to praise not recieve praise lal although that is nice thing to say 3 okay cool thanks 3 m always thinking wow this is waaay abstract and subjective we are good you are great it seems like you just can like techno because it has too little progression it too minimal you rather want house and hate myself to use this term edm if you don know what that fucked up no just wtf no he should have stopped sang another song improvised idk just wanted to make sure know ur awesome the artist in ur cafe what were the responses after yeah don like to feel hate but really do hate is he is not depressed so dont think he needs hypnosis or drugs don think my compliments are superfeicial he knows m dreamer space out all the time and he keeps asking me what yeah it is weird in the beginning cos we are not so good at showing how we feel but trust me it gets incredibly romantic after you kissed and had sex and all that then we are comfortable and oh another thing are you interested about hearing of my really weird and complex fantasy dreams xd yeah know this genuine words of love but are there other things like sometimes try to be really witty and like theater expressive and he just laughs and smiles he thinks it funny to hey just popping by to say absolutly love you guys you are perfect devine wish everyone was like you or idk there is place for everyone but just wanna be with more people like you same her brother and hobby island but kinda like to think there are maaaaaaaaaaany islands and they all float in to eachother and change all the time 1 out of excperience enfp it really amazing my boyfriend is one and he really is the best same with mommy and my sister they are so inntuative they understand me so fast enfj also eh what kind of hypnosis and yeah just keep showering him with compliments often make this really overfantasised description of how awesome he is like we have discussions about who is meant the woman parry is chasing think she called lydia parry himself is enfp crazy sadly the ideas are much stronger then my impacts usually need help for bigger projects btw work extremly well with entj p did my exams in conceptual photography with one we had sounds like kind of smart thing to do but dunno if have the ballz to be that expressive and hold the act for long period of time and in all honesty want them to understand what they are my boyfriend is an enfp he has this weird thing where he keeps saying m much better than him like make lot of paintings and illustrations like have better body and m much better kinda feel this question implies thought you have that we are too lazy to help out

such an anology i actually went ahead and tried to google it came up with some weird things hahahaha well my dad has his phd in physics he pursued it for three main reasons he a very math oriented person but realized math major is not as useful as physics one physics just makes sense to no problemo in response to your last message think you were bit overboard no doubt you were frustrated and puzzled but some of those words are pretty harsh don agree with her behavior that what would do start off like you just met her and then step into it o_o personally would not get mad at that d just clarify what meant but given her emotional state at the time perhaps it would be different however when someone explains what they meant that true it is best to try something and just talk to her again would clear the air and ask for forgiveness have wicked for good stuck in my head just to make sure there aren any ahhh guess d be pretty on par with that forgive super easily but just generally hate fake people like those that act nice for reason don want to be condescending prick but ohmygod loved playing maple but ve been clean for 2 years xd god sound like an addict agree but think she should have been the one to say something care lot about my appearance and looking like m well put together too but not so much for an effect on others it mostly just for me to feel nice but when someone expects me to do guess she might ve gotten attached to you but still don see why she wouldn have said something after the fight personally don see how having rough life and clearing things up are hmmm agree with the acting nice to get something part can you clarify on ll gladly take friend who hurt me with good intentions m confused why good intentions would hurt you unless it not to be killjoy but generally when the parents are against you the chances are kind of slim but if you want you can send her nice email just asking her how she doing make sure it huh that not something would ever do friends pretty much everything else have pretty much never blow up as result of taking something the wrong way as prefer to figure out why you ahhhh the way you explain it it sure does look like have the two switched but guess my realism was more of no matter how hard try nothing will change which seems more cynical than mixed messages nope definitely not in this case imagine said you ll do fine don worry it hard to take that in wrong way at least to me but she historically misunderstood lot m not exactly sure if the right word would be realism or cynicism but here goes in most general descriptions ve noticed that enfps tend to be described as idealistic first off m being alone and losing someone care about gets me to be kind of clingy and it really screws me over with everyone saying teasing d have to disagree tend to just tease anyone physically and verbally because think it fun for me if talk to you on my own initiative lot you re good ve been called awkward lot but it a completely different kind of awkward more of the say something completely unexpected awkward personally like it it keeps people on their toes and terribly selfish no everyone has their agenda and it is indeed nice to help people but only when you have time can make time but what think you have here is not being selfish but being eh hate verbal affirmation never got it much as kid and surely don need it now as an adult or almost adult empty vague compliments generally make me distrust the person especially always took the not giving damn about what others think part as learning to love yourself completely feel like it a good way to live out your life as it truly is your life care about do lot of introspective thinking about who am and how can improve myself the main reasons change myself are 1 it interferes with my lifestyle and interests this generally doesn i mean it human to not like everyone you meet m not sure if it the same case for her but can say some dark mean stuff about people don like however it also pretty obvious don totally agree can say ve met someone d actually want to date long term and short term ones just aren worth the breakup pain used to m really touchy feely huggy with my friends but not so much with someone like or am in relationship with it kind of odd ahhh wish could do that xd it seems too harsh though think ve gotten the infj doorslam before it prettyyyyyyy bad sorry for the double post as m not exactly sure how to mention someone in post noticed you re 6w7 just like me how often do you get in this type of situation how easy is it for you to get thanks for all the responses guys actually forgot to give my own opinion xd notice get really upset and hurt but have an immensely hard time pulling out especially if they contact you take it most enfps and most people in general are pretty good friends what your response when you realize that someone takes your time and attention for granted ahhh yes do do this but m not exactly sure why guess it creates some sort of conversation because waiters waitresses are people too and it some form of guidance however m more that rare ve never said that to anyone as of date listen to sappy romantic ish songs for the first part usually turns out to be rnb or pop it makes no sense but it works amazingly well for me the idea of stress is pretty foreign to me might be because m kind of young and there not too much in my life other than school and friends don get stressed before and after any sort of hmmm actually don really go fish for compliments at least not the empty ones from people that don know too well for me compliments can be broken down into two sections those general read the article bit ago and my first impression was this is some bull if presented with picture which is what the women in the survey were would also say men with non smiling face is could easily take pretty obvious lately as pretty friendly lately at least as far as my girl friends are concerned some can get pretty touchy and gushy but without any feelings or so ',\n",

the need for alone time sometimes m not awkward around groups of people nor do get anxious but do need to just be on my own can definitely relate to your fear of rejection and needing to know that

maybe really it ne what suspect my gf is isfj even though she doesn want to do the test it complicated because she is brazilian and bit shy using english for such things have never felt so secure in taking into consideration that the whole mbti thing is anecdotal then you shouldn take the results of these tests so literally you know we are fucked as species if chuck norris turns around and says we need to start over ouch o damn wanted to troll you with congratulating that your wish shall be granted and you have become and estj but then realised ne is always paired with si well played sir give lot of shit maybe it not really an intp trait perhaps tendency yes but tried to not let the fact that know which function is intp and which is not let affect me as much as possible glad to see the results still were this based on your cognitive functions 1 your mother tongue estonian 1 1 languages you can understand and that will understand you because of your mother tongue but you can write speak in that language 0 1 of finnish which know this is stereotype but your mother tongue is spanish and you can understand portuguese i heard it only works the other way around maybe but then you said yourself give it another century or so which pointed out myself that before that time things are like they are to culturally evolve as vegans it means that we have ok guess went bit off track with my talk since bull fighting and unnecessary animal hunting is not something what is unavoidable but about the oil would argue that despite all the efforts kept editing my post lot its bad habbit agree well nature is the sum of living things living things which invidually have these traits i guess it the result sum of its parts well don think it an entity just think nature is self regulating thing that ends up accidentally doing these things anyway because nature wants to expand it doesn need to be an entity didn mean to say animals actually need to be sacrificed for technological advancements just meant that the more big and powerful the human population gets bronze age vs middle ages vs modern if you are referring to my post then said nothing of the sorts am pretty sure humans especially 7 billion of them have negative effect on the general animal population no edit what yes as said we life on earth is about 3 6 billion years old took it time for species to evolve who can possibly figure out how to escape from the death of the sun but society which can pretty sure they won be living here when our sun dies self aware and intelligent life form like humans is the only way out what if somehow humankind helps animals bread to other planets in other solar system so that when sun goes out with earth the nature doesn the population being at big as it is it seems

ssd since birth which means m deaf in one ear and only until last week when googled about it it has been always natural part of me so never thought of googling about it reminds me some period of time in some areas of europe in middle ages where every hill with castle had it king who didn answer to anyone but this evolved slowly and at one point there was industry doesn work in society where people can do what they want where society is now is the result of discipline partly enforced by laws being civilized and having laws and regulations goes anarchy would be like going back to stone age no ty

who seems to think that infjs don doubt their type they just know they are infjs but here see the opposite even if it just playful ti and when start rambling we are all in your head booo sounds like such an effort to keep it up nah not offended the same thing has crossed my mind several times rationality is the ability to have consistency in one reasoning sometimes it can drive me up the wall if someone is sure of himself but doesn see the gaping holes in his reasoning if he has keep constantly doubting if truly am an intp or how true mbti system itself is but lately read this good description written in personality junkie check it out personality junkie feel the same about most of the posts except the ones about universe which are always fun and coincidentally radiohead in rainbows album is like the only music just can get enough of sits in the corner and drinks straight from his wine bottle yeah don care either pours into glass and sips more with depressed face damn put the answer to the sewing question wrong so that exception is not really an exception haha that is so funny nice one find most intp subforum threads and posts too boring to read maybe they just seem to vague for me also wonder why mostly get around best with fp type girls girls have been in my favourite cartoon definitely must see for all severe intps luzluna these are some pretty interesting points definitely gives new perspective and possibility just wanted to say that edit nvm got it ordered keirsey please understand me and it finally got here now as m reading about nf i find that understand their supposed search for their true selves quite well even though modern software design approaches usually combine both topx96down and bottomx96up approaches 24362 we need intj intp translator nice to see the functions and their blindspots at work here though love getting stuff done for the sole reason of getting them off my mind m always afraid of some impending doom and want to avoid that it what meant actually guess worded it badly frustrating just reminds me how absentminded repeatedly went back to the same joke in this thread here was wondering if the intjs included were thinking ok that enough already or not good laughs damn double post that is so very familiar you worded it quite nicely edit you mean you press yourself for reaching conclusions or that no certain conclusions can be drawn mean you don want you should have grown up in estonia that kind of bs is actually quite foreign to me then again we are rather cold around here don think that most

              " ' all of the above agree that should read the book and wouldn dismiss the whole theory as don have good grasp of it the grouping by temparements has just always seemed bit off to me with the it doesn make sense putting the stapler way over there where the sj colleague prefers it should stay next to the printer where people most often require use of it is typically the kind of answers in the quote after the bolded parts m probably in the minority but like sensors find si endearing and se fascinating like guys who are good at what m bad at stps isfjs and entps are attractive to me well obviously you have never been thinker in relationship with another thinker don relate to this at all m an nt not particularly attracted to nfs m also an introvert most of my relationships have been with extroverts probably because they were more likely to usually prefer going solo as opposed to either lead or follow would say m pretty confident but not overconfident just quite aware of my strengths and weaknesses don understand sfps which means communication problems are more likely but that also means that we re less likely to get close as rule even though m fe inferior and have to work hard to big reason why have hard time with kersey temperament theory is that don relate to the sj stereotypes have been frustrated with esfjs in the past sure just like ve been frustrated if someone is not interested in mbti has poor opinion of it don feel the need to convince them of its value very true from anecdotal experience nf are the most likely to fancy themselves as artists and or to be delusional about their supposed artistic talent interesting theory at this point identify very strongly with ti although also relate to ne and would definitely describe myself as imaginative and creative still when reach the lesson fair enough can picture my isfj mate spouting any soulmate nonsense m an and definitely don believe in soulmates sounds feelerish to me and not in good way mindmates and playmates are fine though and can get the appeal of lifemate had never heard of this stereotype before xnfps are very often described as humorous and fi types can certainly be shit stirring and inappropriate would even guess that the stereotype is that typically it is self deprecating comments or false modesty oh my god look terrible from someone who knows they look great and know these kind of comments can come from sincere insecurity ll take bragging over fishing for compliment any day well wrote that could actually consider her being infjs so don know where you get my impression of njs from m not particularly surprised that many intjs are gamers and happen to think spendidly in my case they get me and are good at what m bad at value honesty and would never lie to someone care about just to be nice however hate receiving unsolicited advice and don offer it myself and m pretty good at keeping my mouth shut voted for the joker well maybe not batman joker d have to add the tech buff and the sweet guy next door believe buffy has been done to death but if someone has some insight d still like to read it m mostly interested in people opinions on dollhouse and firefly since the shows were doh only realised after voting that it was multiple choice my infp female friend studied science has worn her hair short almost her entire life and has always had guy friends my enfp friend sends me the funniest emails they re usually long and cryptic so funny that this thread ended in the wrong forum she seems to get typed as intj more often than as intp which always surprises me because would expect an intj to have more interesting things to do than sit at home watching sick and sad world this hate seeing smart women playing dumb and for the record the esfjs know don play that game either came across as reserved quirky friendly witty awkward funny guarded smiley flaky people are frustrating but if they have redeeming qualities just appreciate that and expect them to flake if not avoid them and hang out with more reliable people that is one reason i ve only read the first page so sorry if this has been adressed but my first thought was gender as my type is predominated by males would have been educated in male environment which might love joan jett think of her as having an stp vibe think we share sense of independance and certain chill attitude that and the way we process things that me as an adult and my istp ex multiple times oh well what can say anyway m still friend with the guy and we ve never argued not once get along great with all xxtps but with honestly don get the sj bias and the anti sensors thing in general tend to think that it has lot to do with many members being quite young irl just don feel persecuted by sjs ve got this love hate thing with enfps tend to attract them for some reason and they can be both extremely charming and extremely annoying they make me laugh lot and we have great convos so relate pretty much to the whole post but yeah this especially relate pretty much to the whole post but yeah this especially as much as identify with ti no type is one function even very unhealthy people use several functions think there would be more to speculate about what is the best way to learn immersion back in the days oz from buffy the vampire slayer more recently wolverine as portrayed by hugh jackman right now monroe in grimm guess must have wolf thing and didn realise that bookshops and libraries nature doesn appeal that much to me my mistake muchaparadox husband is intj misread the original poster note that both your husband and you are perceivers which might have an impact on how you feel about the thinking feeling divide m under the impression that as thinker ti think that entps and estps charisma stems from their charm while with istps it comes from another place naah m pretty cute so get why people are saying it peggy strikes me as ixfj the way she does what she has to do without making fuss is typical fe aux to me agree with isfp for betty she has those te inferior outbursts and don see her using voted esfp because didn realise the poll was multiple choice but really meant exfps so yeah tertiary te or maybe tertiary te and auxillary fi combined ll play m thinking in the lines of popular fiction mean it not like you come across real life people comparable to superman or the beast on regular basis so for genius bruisers m m an nt and definitely not super scientist type m ok with stress when it lasts for while tend to act more extroverted though what not to love was actually coming over to start an isfj appreciation thread after coming across the thread about si doms in the functions forum anyway few things that love they are ',\n",

to yep envy them for that wish could have been born little earlier so could experience all of that with clearer recollection than do now born in 1983 feel often like m inbetween generations identify much more with millienials than do gen ers most of the time the times do feel like grumpy old man telling the kids men gi joe duck tales darkwing duck talespin aladdin the tv show mighty max gargoyles how the world seemed to make so much more sense and feel so much stabler back then it funny was watching the cnn documentary on the 90s that been coming on sundays and it seems like so much after spending well over decade playing mmos ve discovered ve forgotten how to really enjoy well any other type really that isn to say that haven been able too but always find my wife and are watching naruto again like it but greatly prefer the japanese with english subs she likes watching the dubbed so we re watching the dubbed yes not proud of it but some slights can be forgiven in that instance try and shut doorslam that person out as much as can don like feeling that way don like dealing with just logged back in and discover the last post posted in was back in 2014 yikes anyway herr row understand and agree with what you are saying about learning the values and strengths about other times the thing is with entps tend to have love hate relationship with them know some in d just like to say that can relate to this too this problem is actually one of my bigger reasons for intensely disliking lot of entps yep ve always been the guy that will be friends with the person no one else wants to be friends with lot of it was self acceptance ve accepted myself and am happy with myself for who am at my core and have begun to build around that ve started doing some things outside of my comfort zone enfjs worked well for me and get along with them fabulously extps and exfps are definitely my favorites though yes you should when ve been rejected by women try very hard to put on confident easy going exterior in hopes that don make the other party feel anymore awkward than they already do the was hurt lot when was kid so withdrew inward and kept to myself along the way made few friends and after going through really rough depression discovered it was ok to be me there really isn much can add to teddy post but did want to comment on couple of things it is true that isfjs strongly value the opinions of our friends and loved ones as we often unfortunately another person self esteemis not something you can bring up by yourself it sounds to me like she may want to consider seeing therapist as such mindset is not at all healthy and lets hope she doesn duck out at the last minute again proud good post confidence is still somewhat new thing to me didn have any at all growing up and went through very deep depression about 10 years or so ago which resulted in two type 2w1 sx so instinctual variants same here which is habit hate that have because what usually ends up happening is the other party senses that something is amiss and drags it out of me which then annoys them that didn i picked up please understand me ii by david keirsey and scored as isfj ve also taken several different tests and scored isfj all but twice where scored istj partially because m busy with other things real life obligations etc and partially because may have already said what wanted to say female hinata probably because can relate to her very well suspect she an isfj herself used to have naruhina avatar when posted here before male tie between naruto and pain quite alright had assumed you made that conclusion based on my low post count no worries thank you again for the welcome back it much appreciated eta konan hello to you too as far as know this is my old account just changed my avatar and sig but otherwise this was my old one mostly lurked and only posted here and there hello all used to post here some time ago but think almost year or so ago just stopped stuff happened got pulled to another forums all kinds of silliness anyone just wanted to say esxp s preferably but s are really nice too ve met two estp women and both made want to come out of my shell and chase after them they bring out the best in me and love that hey lady i sincerely hope didn give you the impression that was judging you or something you sound like you do your fair share around the home and it sounds like your parents have no happy birthday bossman live in st augustine if you re ever up in this area let me know could actually handle military relationship because would know that eventually she ll be home for good in this particular case we had no way of changing it and didn want to have to keep quick knee jerk response your brother is being an ass hat more thoughtful response usually it the otherway around isfj are usually the ones giving of themselves to the point of killing that how it usually seems to work out my first f who loved very much was an enfj that lived all the way up in canada that a bit of distance from this florida boy hmm wow think my answer is going to be somewhat different than others here xd d like woman who is strong confident very expressive of herself and her feelings doesn mind me being all scored 18 which means fit the bill so do get t shirt when am actually at work am dutiful and hard working presuming that what m doing has any kind of value if get stuck doing something really tedious or brain dead then ll have difficult ve been told m good ballroom dancer for someone who just picked it up 6 months ago so ve found that enjoy showing it off bit otherwise no not really could see why isfj females might detest that sterotype will say though as guy do hope to be family man one of these days d love to have wife and daughter can spoil rotten 8 just requoting as simply could not have said it any better myself also m exactly the same way about my being punctual m usualy 10 15 minutes early to wherever it is need to be and it just requoting this because it how feel couldn have said it better hrm not to nitpick but what kind of happiness are we talking about here like gentle state of contentment romantically wistful utterly endearing to try and answer your question from the not at all no will say though that like lady i don 100 fit the general description of being an isfj for example love ballroom dancing love going out and dancing performing for believe it or not m usually the one doing the pursuing though will say it probably very different from most types usually when m interested in woman show very noticeable interest in this should be an interesting thread cool would appeal to his sense of duty and his commitment and desire to be with his family assuming that his boss is really an isfj then that will stick with him concur you guys are truly great match for us sj you guys and ladies refuse to let me dwell in my comfort zone and instead continue to push encourage and inspire me to come out and 1 always thought we were fairly simple bunch to understand as for me only know few people who sound like enfp and they re cool people we re not close friends or anything but

never worry about it either if people look at me funny like just laugh and say talking to myself again must be going crackers it is just life and the way it is today we seem to be do not like shoes with pointy toes like you think they look bit spiteful or mean also used to trip over the point as it you give an unreal sense of space and balance also bad for your and pull face when look in my mirror and go omg crazy hi rofl ever done it in front of the mirror laughing good way of putting it wink you have so much wisdom in you wish more thought the way you do happy thank you for your insight on the subject you really have given it lot of thought do the same sometimes and just go round in circles and fail to understand how loving god could allow agree it is the parents who give the unconditional love not the kids they tend to demand it and think of it as their right cool follow you now thanks ll laugh with you and try not to take mysel too seriously maybe it is because we are bit unsure now m being pathetic blushed am bit puzzled about idontdiiit trylieknike long reply is she talking of herself and disliking the traits of infjs when she is an infj herself people of all types tend to change views and have no idea ll wait and see what other thinkers will come up with then maybe d understand it bit thank you your reply and thoughts on the matter are so wise and it is such brilliant answer you are right in all of the things you say but we need the wisdom to be able to discern these yep don believe in worshipping statues of gods the catholics bow before the altar when they enter church and at easter they have ceremony called adoration of the cross where the people thanks understand that answer because it does not involve all the jargon scientists use think you have much more enquiring minds and want to explore bit by bit how things work which thank you your theories are all so complicated for me to really understand and the more find that questioning the hows the whys etc poses yet more questions that it seems impossible to find have no real personal beliefs in any of the religious doctrines other than believe there is some super force power that has created the earth and its planets it is wondrous thing to me sometimes wonder whether some types use mask or disguise like to be open about all things but not in an offensive way so someimes find have to say nothing or just agree without getting such truthful response don know why either is it because we feel unsure internally hate it just as you do if try to make some sort of response or join in people maybe othe types find that one train of thought leads so easily into another sometimes wonder that what comes out at the end of it had anything to do with the beginning of it e thought it is crazy kind that is nice will try and learn from this lot of it applies feel that being an infj we worrry about upsetting the internal equilibrium and foresee disaster mile off if some sort of guilty at least know it we like to be needed and yep we do like to be loving someone once called me clinging vine that really upset me but it made me think bit do not know why that is nice from what you say about intps being spooked and attacked at watering holes could not the intp being aerial fly off in time before the attack occurs or would the intp be duped by the like seahorses as well they are so pretty as child thought they were just fairytale creatures and did not realise that they actually do exist there are so many beautiful jewel like tactics and strategies are they not very similar or is strategy plan and tactics the method of putting them into action if this is the case what happens if person can be strategic but not hi everlea thank you for your response lke to think m feline type but am supposed to be according to the perseus system aerial and skylark well that is nice too but sort of does not also vertigo similar to seasickness which is like the effect when riding on the big dipper throwing ourselves off balance compulsion to satisfy the senses like drinking seawater so yes as you thank you for explaining see what you mean by the learning thing e some learn by rote but do not understand whereas some others might learn more slowly and use their internal color magenta do not believe that seeing is believing we need to use all our senses to be able believe something as actual real we are being duped so much of the time as to what we should what do the s stand for g magpies in cops and robbers pigs are very like the human from their internal anatomy that is why so many transplants are from pigs pet pig can be quite seet if cats have degree of echo location and so do dogs they can pick up on sounds not audible to the human ear this was proven in an experiment on joanna lumley tv programme catwoman where she was are your dreams in colour or black and white my dreams are always in colour don why some only ever dream in black and white have never ever had dream that involves animals the worst little birds are cute they can spot lions and wovles from their flight among the clouds and thus avoid flying across the oceans they can dip and and take little fish to sustain them they can sometimes wonder if am bit that way inclined too as keep changing things around if they do not look quite right am highly organised and tidy chaos bothers me and have to sort very wise animal indeed must be for an intp much more astute and wary like it thank you cool the wolverine americans and brainwashing not only americns all govts all media that is good one but need to know more about entps unsure love cats too am real softee for their endearing ways wink if one puts any creature on scalding hot tin roof they want to get away from it d a cat returns loyalty or maybe knows where it is better off skylark is nice though because we can fly over is the somebody else not man then animals cannot compose compatibility charts because they cannot do maths the way man has been taught by man to do learn maths yet maybe they can as thinking pussy cat because they are independent loyal don ask for much other than food and little bit of loving they are real cool creatures very noble and always adored by the how does the maths come into it where do you get the figures from are they formed from the numbers of the letters in the alphabet in straight form viz 1 and 26 why did you multiply intp all the time indoors and talk to my cat thank you for that so really what you are saying is that one has to understand the way animal behaviours differ from each other and then this sort of behaviour can be related to the different what brings you to the conclusions you make with types and animals rather like the infj being skylark confused hi again luton is about 30 miles

past couple of years my best friend my brother five other close friends who weren bffs but we knew each other well couple of business ve run up against this twice in my life the first time was in high school when friend dscovered the mormon church and over time completely embraced it it began to affect our friendship in dearly love old houses living in one is whole other thing plumbing electrical

go the worst to me would be long slow lingering pain wracked one ve always believed used to have problem being told what to do until joined the military lol before then it was more natural for me to

reasonable solutions towards fixing them noticed for me talking to talking out loud helps me bit having conversation about the topic with another person who understands it and can clarify topics or

situation doesn have to be tethered by reality it could be something birthed entirely from the imagination it could be something simple like why don you present us more information about your life give us more to work with are you attending school do you live at home is your relationship with your family dysfunctional etc if we believe what you ve typed to be mostly true m generally hesitant to give advise to people unless understand the nature of their problem considerable dialogue is usually established night go behind their backs and make shit better without them ever realizing it then

environment and have not looked at studies or anything but believe drug use has more to do with an individual environment than it does personality type there is no such thing as thinking too much it

or know so am pretty sure if he needs to gossip about me with someone he can find people to do it with also you asked him why had to wait to be married to have anything ours his answer was so think there is no difference between being married and being boyfriend and gf said yes there is we thought about it wish knew what the real deal is asked him and what had said above was his answer hi james am new too when you kill roach and then suddenly think about how it must have felt for the roach and can almost physically feel that the way you did it was horrible and you then feel bad lol am 27 and still know nothing in this life and still feel as confused as when was 13 did not read the comments but am infp and cry all the time whenever get too emotional and it doesn matter if it is because smth good happened or smth bad remember went to school miss my estj partner so bad feel like there is humongous emotional gap between us and feel like he doesn love me any more doesn ever miss me and stuff and so want to call him but i definitely want family and children sitting at home all the time probably not but am not clubbing bar going person enjoy company of friends and cant wait to make my nest will say in advance that my post will be about unhealthy estj think he is unhealthy me and my estj partner argued yesterday to the point when think we have no future together he is 31 agree but people often don ask and even if they do other people lie coz they are too scared to tell the truth out of fear of not having decent relationship with roommate neighbor friend or am 27 he is 31 mean things twice he called me stupid he apologized once or twice he called me bitch he calls me hypocrite lot he called me liar do not know how many times he there is always someone in those affairs who is victim and doesnt even know considering how horrible the guy is to her and he cheats she deserves to know and of course her bf wont tell her coz he not talking to me for days withholding sex or any kind of affection completely or even do something on purpose that he knows will hurt me to teach me because do not understand it any other way am not sure about anything any more am sure love him am not sure if we have future together yes 1000000000000000000000000 was that girl please do her favor tell her know it is scary and he is ur roommate and ppl like to pretend to be emus and hide their heads in sand but beg you she doesnt deserve it think am neurotic too am not sure tho doubt loose my temper always resort to crying over pretty much everything and when am worried about anything at all can study can work no must say it is not the case in my situation my partner is not healthy guess he wants me to share everything with him and by everything really mean everything even the smallest details lies are not equal for me and may be other idealists lie to avoid criticism of my guardian so who is always insensitive suspicious and will ask me 10000 questions and nit pick about the details have to admit that if knew you in real life most likely would not like you wicked queen at all for being heartless and not care about anyone just saying since we are sharing actually think it is mature thing to be polite to each other especially in public if you can not control yourself and can not be polite on public may be you should not go to the bday she acts the funny thing is walking on shell is being in relationship with someone who prefers superficial relationships it is like you can never rely on that person and this person for sure will never it is funny coz my estj bf did just that dumped me and wanted me back then again 5 times in 1 5 years think that issue is not related to the personality type at all do not know if it is only personality types issue or what it is but in my 1 5 years relationship most of the time have been feeling misunderstood and unloved my so is not nearly as this is such great answer and so wish everyone was able to work things out that well my question to you is how did you manage to not get upset and accept that he is always right and not thank you when for many days you are writing 365 things love like wish for you or about you for your significant other and put all your heart and sould in it even knowing that he will not appreciate it as ',\n",
              " 'i not even positive of my own type but d really like to try and get closer to figuring out my sister a few months ago was talking to her about mbti and got her to take few tests but i don think you re necessarily wrong d be interested for other people to weigh in on the se vs ne thing for lorelai because people might have some good points to back up one or the other was why do you think lorelai is esfp ve seen her typed that way before though thought ne because don know that ever saw lorelai as being all that concrete she was always going from one thing was thinking about this after posted isfj doesn use ni does it said it did but it doesn i was mistaken think don even know why rory should be an ni user now that am re agree with the above d put rory down as infj in the past but could see how she could be an isfj as well and can see what people mean when they mentioned si ne guess put rory as infj d honestly do both first d start questioning why someone would do that and would say how ridiculous it was and why d never do that then d probably offer help if could do that quite don blame you actually it starting to bug me bit now lol just staring at that title my sister seems to be an enfp and she is more extroverted and generally more comfortable with people than am she much less likely to just freak out at people than am she be just an angry as do sound kind of one ish in this questionarre feel couldn be one though because don relate to the descriptions of perfectionism and such but one ish type things do seem to drive me that funny m pretty sure m not yeah no know m not unless ve misinterpreted that type completely see that rather extroverted type and am not and see no way that se is my most 38558 see couple things first impressions first it makes me think of innocence and hope for the future when first look at it young girl witnesssing something but is it something already replied here but wanted to say something else the person was talking about does display signs of 6 they have done suppose what would be six ish thing and clung to most of them but d say wrath sloth and pride most of all m not sure if you re on point or not m huge mad men fan having seen the majority of the episodes various times but ve never given much thought to typing for the characters so m unsure could be wrong but from what m presumed of myself thus far m an infp 6w7 gryffindor hazel wand unicorn core 10 1 4 inches reasonably supple sister is an enfp gryffindor laurel yes undoubtedly believe an abuse victim could turn out to be absolutely any type do not know what type am exactly feel am 6 but feel can relate to other types perhaps in my tri could be wrong on some of these arya istp daenerys infj or enfj ve seen her typed infj but wonder if she not really an enfj catelyn think esfj think she seemed more isfj in i meant what said earlier but wonder if gave the wrong impression or don mean loner in the way others mean it it difficult for me because actually am rather emotional and expressive and not entirely true about this rigging business know someone who has been keeping the data on pottermore sortings and almost always the sortings makes sense and certain answers consistently go with some of the names for particular type can probably be kind of sweeping generalization that might not be accurate for everyone of that type but quite like what ve seen the nf temperament be think you can be loner and still be quite functional and psychologically normal ve always considered myself loner at heart just like my own company surrounded by books music good could understand the correlation but was wondering if it not possible well m sure it possible for person not so happy childhood to lead them to being 9 because know someone who thanks that helps was always leaning toward infp but in my last thread had some comments that were leaning isfp and it started to confuse me personally did think was more infp just so did thread on here few months ago and the consensus game down to infp or isfp but nothing absolutely conclusive as to which once came into this mbti stuff thinking was infp or possibly my worst anger if very much how kyrielle described hers m an ixfp sorry don know which it depends on the type of situation person though with my sister and to lesser extent my mom my mom is an istj believe and she is not soft towards or over indulgent or really at all indulgent of people feelings but she is quite understanding of people but she expresses this in very congratulations you scored efj not sure of the accuracy but it interesting was trying to go by my 8 9 ish age suppose don see much reason to think was introverted as quote dreamer777 2157976 think you re entp entp can be introverted sometimes and as far as the p thing goes s are actually less judgmental than s are so the best to look at p is to before understood what it really meant to be an introvert or extrovert used to wonder if there was something wrong with me like was anti social or not fun because knew people who could go find it difficult to type my parents as both can be quite mentally emotionally unhealthy but think my mom might be some sort of sj it strange because she loves fantasy sci fi stuff so know no one answering maybe they see it an old thread they already glanced in and don want to to bother but it doesn make much sense to make new thread when ve already got one so ve been looking more into enneagram and thought 9wing 8 made some sense because of my nature tendency to be passive and liking harmony but also being confrontational argumentative okay thanks remember actually taking that same quiz before and getting moderate on se though so that why was unsure that result was accurate this time and might have been me not answering so does anyone know what any of this indicates to be an infp isfp or something is it possible to have good use of fe is that typical or no my fi is higher but did cognitive functions test m not sure how completely accurate it is as can change answers on things sometimes depending on my mood extraverted sensing se try reading this while we re on the subject and see which you identify with more this is usually quick way to figure out whether you are ne dom or fi dom if neither of them resonate with year ago typed as 4wing3 when took an enneagram quiz and it seemed to fit me fairly well but doing more research felt didn think it was possible do not think am 4 care about hm can come across confident at times but go back and forth with that all the time first want to say sorry for abandoning this after asking for help was quite busy at the time with holiday stuff and then just kept putting it off because knew d probably end up wanting to am posing this because ve been browsing

comfortable with girl will do everything that your intp did have been asked if was dating girl before when just figured we were close friends get extremely shy besides the fact that you re hot they don really know anything about you further proof that intp are sexy and mysterious cool girls have to approach me like they would wild animal slowly and talking to me in calm voice the entire time if they make any sudden moves or raise their voice run away at least the ever since can remember ve woken up with the song from winnie the pooh that goes got to get up got to get goin gotta meet some

anything that is natural and not posing for the camera when you re at the casino and attracted crowd for winning 10 measly dollars from slots not because you won but because you made it sound like you won jackpot my visual memory is top notch however remembering names is hard was about two years old and it was nighttime on summer day the air felt nice and cool with nice breeze was taking walk holding my mom hand what remember was me looking down on my think was pretty weird for some reason befriended and connected with lot of infps they seem pretty interested and bizarre like that the popular kids we re too into sports and e is the nice good luck with the event would go but my summer budget is almost hitting empty crazy don wanna pop tire and get stranded in the middle of the blazing desert will definitely youngest of four boys except there is big age gap so grew up like an only child what you talking bout if that you in your avatar you got wings man freaking wings that is

when doing so you see yourself in an older form when you are fully concentrated always do your best to face your fears insecurities and problem otherwise they will always be on your subconscious or even unconscious mind do not just try to get rid of regrets but reflect m more of musical person then lyrical person even if the songs got crazy lyrical message will get thrown off if it have bad rhythm however if m in bad mood there is nothing after reading this chuckled happy what absent minded err no way my mind is always thinking of crazy randomness more like information overload to point of malfunction haha one of the things that help anchor me is just to have rough plan of some future goals that the only thing that help me come back to reality everyday m idealizing like moby said even now that look at it m pretty mediocre in all of my skills boooooooo crying became the mario in my stats yea that determination that enfps have is great and all just wish it was on all the time whenever feel like the force is doubting me become an overachiever however once the situation cools yeah it pretty annoying it like they friends only expect us to be funny and fun to be around it might be because we re usually the one that give advice so it would be weird for them to have don i feel out of place came in here thinking there was some research done explaining why the big bad wolf from the the three little pigs is an enfp walk away disappointed haha grats on succeeding what random and funny thread nope m actually good with tools guess m well developed m handyman for my oldest brother whenever he need me for his remodeling everyone can be annoying don think it single down to personality type but if we re annoying to everyone we meet then it a problem otherwise why does it matter m pretty sure if actually wake up with enough time then sure ll eat breakfast even then its just cereal and some fruit otherwise it a cup of coffee to go love making breakfast at night though been noticing this lot lately sometimes just ask question that secretly know the answer to already kind of annoying really because once they answer me it just reassured my answer and m my money always go toward the toilet literally eat out too much if you think you can do it you re right if you think you can do it you re right but my motto for life is to treat others how would like to be treated can always push others away but physically 5 0 5 5 cute and has nice eyes and as long as she is not total stick or the opposite of that emotionally good sense of humor understanding and organized one that is not thanks for the post man this is exactly how feel at this point in my life feel so much lighter and even doing the most mundane tasks doesn seem that bad this is exactly why m fascinated by hahaha yea how is this healthy is this an appreciate enfpness in disguise say so reading this thread make me appreciate my extreme outlooks take intense feelings then dull and calm anyday lol this is the most weirdest thread to read is this even coming from my fellow enfps it is indeed mediocre to even read got up took shower brushed my teeth made coffee drove to school finished school drove home ate went to work got home from work check mail post this post haha get this with friends and family almost all the time just think its funny its more fun talking in similes and metaphors because being direct is sometimes too boring most of the time i would say farmer everyday month and season is routine nahh although respect their knowledge don think can live with one my whole life do not want to be the one they want to experiment on plus some of them can be too mean maybe if their you get sad or happy for no absolute reason you suck at having poker face but can still win from manipulation take the longest to choose sides because you see the pro n con of you read everything in the you know you re an infp when section and can relate to everything however instead of feeling happy about yourself you feel sad said this in the infp you know you re not infp and an enfp when you can relate to everything an infp says in here but instead of feeling relief you feel sad frustrating welcome to the pcafe the place where weirdness is cool on topic its all about the face and mostly the eyes well if the time come and the plan is little more detail might think about it nope never gotten used to the heat m more of seattle type of guy thank god for c whoa august 21 22 that a crazy long time from now doesn help that it is six hour drive arizona would like to go just for the laugh and experience but highly doubt can make it m like the op if practice what say only once flow without even have to look at notes however if just straight up wing it stumble and have lost of thoughts my head move faster than can relate to everything you said my e is exactly like yours what quoted from you really strike me it sucks moving to new city and letting my introverted side take over me the only time well back on topic was obedient child was shy and quiet the first week of school after that though would get complains from teacher to my parent that talk too much was the class what shampoo and conditioner mixes doesn worked what about the 3 in 1 that they sell now shampoo conditioner body and face wash all in one bottle lol when saw that at the drug store nope not at all only when m sleeping listening to boring lectures in boring meeting driving eating taking shower and mostly when m by myself so yea not so much yea its not even that hard got all my books and research right in front of me can even crack it open sigh man gotta finished this literary analysis so unmotivated depend on where am if m with my friends use dark or sexual humor if m with girls used sweet and sexual humor eventually used intellectual and sarcastic humor then they all leave all the freaking time angry its like can think logically without my feelings getting in the way vice versa see it as arguing with inner kid that keep on wanting ice cream even though ',\n",
              " ' can say that enfps are good friends but this combo didn work out as romantic relationship in my case prefer to date the thinking types don get the idea of dating somebody with high think that you don want to be friends with this intj any more but trying to fix things because you know each other for 4 years when somebody is so irritating you can stand his presence it most of people when self typing have problem with the choice of the right functions coming from this type somebody and be 100 sure according to they behaviour is practically impossible my answer will be no different than others keep learning retire from job isn equal with retire from thinking like doing some things in specific way which is important to me from someone perspective it may be seen as traditional but it more personal tradition not the common currency m not your description of this person doesn reveal they thinking process only some facts about interests he surely is an introvert and thinker it better to read about the cognitive functions and exactly my thoughts m quite sure she doesn treat you as burden when don like being with someone just stop seeing them from your post can see that your friend really likes your company intj even same here think when you did something stupid you should be aware of the consequences also hate when people read watch sad news and start whining or even crying because of it what worse when can see lot of fi in those answers there is ni would say that you are an intj when you describe your thinking process the way you act and your way of communicating with used to think just like you when was younger all my friends were in relationships and had boyfriends but no me boys were attracted to me but have never taken anyone seriously because they and just one thought about this being too nice situation sometimes can act like that when don know what to do when someone who is close to me is having problem m not able to comfort maybe it not an advice you want to hear but just say the intj everything you wrote if my best friend would said to me something like that would be happy because we could just come back to our in time 7 10

mojego lg p760 przy użyciu tapatalka think it depends on specific person my best friend is an enfp we have known each other for 20 years she is bit scatterbrained and procrastinates lot but surely isn as lazy as your ex generally don like yelling shouting and loud noises because as said they make me feel uneasy and nervous when m talking to someone usually speak slowly and prefer when the counterpart know one entp and he is very passionate during the debates he can be extremely loud and expressive when talking but he is always very logical with his reasoning maybe your friend is mixing your all my boyfriends were thinking types one of them was surely an entp now m dating an entj this is an interesting relation te is all about usefulness it concentrates on how your ideas will work

ve proper chatted before but now its way past time to sleep so must retreat have good night all and into slumber pleasantly fall no its good to have conversation about this don think either of us are wrong since we perceive the same thing in different ways we both subscribe to different philosophies so we each see are personally have much stronger science background than philosophy so use objectivity as my sliding scale it has always seemed to me that nihilism has branched out from this of course because most nihilists are 15 years old no but do generally agree with nihilism but some

because feel blind traveler most of the time ignore it there just been load of stuff lately which has been horrible if were to properly react would be perceived differently and am careful about how to be honest wastefulness really distresses me why do people spend so much money on nothing like so much can comprehend why that proper does me in do understand but also don blind traveler cont ego convo most of the time things slide with me since its not worth the effort to tutor stupid people but nothing can crack your ego like being patronised and seen as second sorry if m bit late on this stream of thought but find also feel this way can understand how someone feels but most of the time find it funny rather than distressing but if someone was redeemofself just dipping cheeky little toe in the water good way to find out if people are legit crazy rather than ironically sadistic wink drunk parrot yep seems so according to this quote from wikipedia the killing for me was secondary got no rise as such out of it for the most part but the figuring it out the challenge the oh opps that was just me imaging how he would say he was testing his crossbow what tone the would use continue in that sentence to disagree with myself also in my timezone its quite bit past drunk parrot yeah probs but to do something for fun is different from doing it for nothing d say that would be an emotional reason to do something but feel like this context could probably be oh you cheeky parrot wot are you like or maybe he was really drunk and too embarrassed to say it nah mate m such stone killa wot little diva ice man was putting more then bodies was just thinking about what would ask him in the interviewers place since it seems like an exceedingly cruel and wasteful way to try out crossbow to

enfp read this stuff and want to cry cause m so happy to find out there a whole bunch of alexandra166 girl consider his breaking up with you the last kind thing he did for you it had nothing to do

both have great careers stable relationships and great kids the violici consider yourself hugged m big time hugger well astrology could be bunk dunno but my aquarian profile is almost perfect match to

really bothers you can see your words but it much bigger than the words hi jennywocky read your post early this morning before went to work and can get it out of my head so need to respond so can get some work done can only speak from my own nice to know there are others from oz laughing so had thing happen to me today and don know if it cause read this thread this morning was in my usual happy

warmth and sincerity that we feeler women require laughing can say it clear cut for me to always follow my heart and not my plan because sometimes the plan is really what want at the end of the day and my heart is being impulsive and impulsiveness jennywocky my 7 o son is just starting to to the exact same thing and he an esfp as well it freaking me out bit when it happens ve tried to deal with this couple of different wow so many good points raised love really good self aware conversation makes me all tingly inside awesome tried to search but that didn come up will read now pretty much to

saikick 1571045 my hypothesis is that intj are the rule followers and rule enforcers of life the rule following you describe is more istj style rule following know couple istjs in m back from my little vacation and haven been here in while so thought d give bit of an update on some of the things ve found out step grandfather esfj uncle mother side m fairly certain that this one has already been said and would be fairly disappointed if it hadn been said but something that immensely pisses me off is when people who have nothing to say don stop posting now the more people who post here the better go to well went to school with group of kids who designed fusion machine thought this would be relevant because the machine fits in the palm of your hand apparently and can be plugged did bring book to mine the great gatsby loved every letter of it and treasured it more for the fact that it distracted me from the tedious boring crap going on around me these are all really helpful thanks everyone for taking an interest in this it still seems like personality or at least the cognitive functions that make up the personality are more or less inheritable being mindless like that it just shudders too horrible for words not being able to control yourself and only thinking about eating that even worse the very nature of zombies who only d say the scariest prospect of zombies is that they turn you mindless too being turned into something incapable of individual thought ah no it too terrifying the way the istj functions break down is as follows introverted sensing extroverted thinking introverted feeling extroverted intuition then there the entp extroverted intuition first and foremost sorry about the name mix up that was entirely my bad on to present matters your father you said was entj and that he would not part with his money my dad is entj and is the ambiguity is just fine because will often lean towards extroverted thinking and then few hours later ll be leaning towards introverted thinking ll be sure to include several other factors that affect personality type although people do go through six year period where they try on personality types to see what fits and it is possible may be wrong about him being entp it just that when was reading his book brain droppings he really struck me as entp don know why it just seemed to fit guess that the mystery of m probably going to get this thread stickied it looks like it may need it also it appears that m going to need to re test my theory on personality type inheritance intj rage the only thing worse than ignoring them ignoring them while glaring the horrors think that maybe lewis black is intj george carlin entp enjoyed his wit just about as much as my entp friends enjoy mine just think that people personality is either inherited or learned from their parents right now m thinking it may be little of both you know really have tosh pegged as an esfp he has the same view as society and same desire for new jokes as my brother does and my brother is an esfp so m pretty sure he esfp on the ve learned that can talk to extroverts if they have something interesting to talk about if they don i just don bother talking to them the thing m curious about is where your ti came from not problem and if they don want to try browsing the intp and entj forums and seeing if your parents act like any of them congrats col it looks like you somehow managed to not inherit any of your personality from your parents edit alright skadi m going to just wildly guess here and say that between have misbehaving photographic memory can remember things fairly easily but sometimes forget that remembered them that probably makes no sense can remember every person ve met maybe you should link this post on the isfp forum and see what they have to say it might help out bit to see if they can identify with any of the things you are saying going postal terry pratchett read 100 pages of this book in three hour class period it really good and the sarcastic wit should appeal to quite few nts it cool d rather people not post step family members m more looking for blood relatives but if it just so important to you that it has to be done m not going to stop you well it possible to get all the functions in reverse mean here look at my dad function breakdown te ni se fi now look at my brother se fi te ni almost exact opposite but ll start me intj mother isfj father entj brother esfp those are all the confirmed immediate family members ve got edit to include few others maternal grandmother istj basically the description says it all what your personality type and that of your immediate brothers sisters mother father family members speculation and guessing are just fine here you know your parents or in my case my dad is nt when you give them the test and they get an nt result this may just be me it may also fit in with my other post but saying something and then saying lol jk god that hurt to type pushes me very near the point of homicide if you re just going to you know you re entp if you don completely flip shit every time your intj friend criticizes the ideas you tell us about another thing that never fails to piss me off when somebody attempts to subtly manipulate me know what they re doing m not going to go along with it either directly tell me or stop ve been thinking about this question for while now hadn seen this post before but wish had and decided that the infp imagination compliments the intj creativity the thing that pisses me off more than probably anything in the world is the phrase you re too young to understand do not like to be disregarded just because of something as trivial as my age ironically was musing about that just yesterday when was pondering the difference between intj sarcastic wit and entj sarcastic wit m pretty happy with the way ve newly portrayed him found this while was researching the entj and thought should share it able to turn conflict situations into positive lessons using this d say that my latest choice fits the actions of an really don see this as trying to get you to write it for me m just showing dialogue and seeing if this is what you would say you guys say how you would react and tailor it to be so m alright here the latest reworking of it this will probably be the last time post this tonight ve already spent way too much time on this chapter alright here it is ah you re right he doesn do it at her desk he walks over to the corner of the room and then begins to plan his conversation with god and when he begins to verbalize it she shows concern that he sitting in the impossible is merely challenge to be tackled and overcome saw one of you say that when you were stressed you talk to yourself so maybe should have the character sit in the corner of the room and talk to himself and then have the receptionist come in fact it just the opposite he almost teasing the main character for his serious nature drunken shepherd better not try to fuck this wolf that dangerous and just generally not good idea don know asking your living sister how she died just to start debate with her does sound kind of like something an entp would do edited it to make him less whiny and more concise and decisive here the new line thought up don care how omnipotent he is if he created time he should be able to

end and m starting to feel like m slacking here you shouldn be the one doing all excellent points although don know too much about soso right now to draw any stark contrast also can debate you on any points related to pe or pi because ve only vaguely heard of them will try to explain it as see it se is the function related to taking in information from the present moment and responding to it piper makes decisions as things become relevant don that is definite possibility have some significant difficulty understanding si itself but know it deals with the way things happened in the past in regard to minutia and details that one that wasn what meant m sorry should explain it better what meant was that if her dietary concerns were part of an nf idealism rather than an sf trend she would probably have brought okay so haven done hardcore analyses of every single character yet have my suspicions but nothing to back them up however ve been developing an opinion on piper and if m wrong want dear new infp friend it is not very often that meet someone as eager to share the limelight as you most often can simply deflect the questions enough so that m learning significantly more dear mother ve pretty much decided not to tell you this in real life except maybe once quite while ago though don remember clearly but you seem to have figured it out anyways even hi there if you couldn tell by the

could say this was hard dear food network on the off chance that m not lettuce farmer fish farmer an herb gardener butcher or hunter where the hell am supposed to get all these ingredients yeah ve heard that the more you advance in education the more intuitive it becomes m in college and have to say agree with that assessment think it because lot of higher no we don need compliments never ever compliment an introvert it pisses us off have never been angrier than when someone tells me m talented at something or that they enjoy something do so take it you feel that lot of people have mis typed themselves as intuitives when they are actually sensors due to not understanding questions on the test or applying the questions to this thread looked interesting figured d go ahead and answer

              " ' that been my experiences with istps the ones know have very very high threshold but when it passed they can hold back the anger can relate to nearly all of this except just got out of ltr with an istp and we dated in our mid to late twenties the boldest bits especially resonated with me love the guy to bits photo with smile like guys who look fun istps man pretty sexy intjs are pretty great too though think maybe this was what was trying to get at ignoring feelings maybe wasn the right word would it be more fair to say sometimes istps don realize their feelings are effecting them at someone who leans toward being rational thinker but still has the capacity to openly discuss feelings someone who likes to experience new things and has ambition do er someone who m working with therapist right now in dealing with failure really struggle with letting go of mistakes ve made particularly ones that may have hurt other people or let others down the totally we re opposites but we learn so much from one another think istjs are pretty awesome they and istps are probably my two favourite types though its so hard to say ve never dated an istj but my very best friend is one so think can speak bit changed in to message on op wall don want to go off topic with this thread sorry istps for the interruption think istps have some pretty deep feels at times if they ve been given chance to explore them over time in my experience and istp may have super deep feelings but these things happen they ahh yes was one of those girlfriends as an enfp that really needs verbal expressions of love on regular continual basis had the hardest time figuring out my ex istp just because we were so used to worry lot when was dating my existp that something was wrong when d check in he just say m fine eventually learned that istps or at least he are pretty direct and to the dated an istp for many years and think that she sort of sounds like an istp too m no pro at typing people however oh man my friends have consistently commented on how eclectic my wardrobe is love wearing really outgoing pieces hi recon m an intj fan love deep thinkers and the intj that m dating is one of them he very analytical which is pretty attractive to me he also always working to improve himself hi enfps do you struggle with leaving relationships when you ve been the dumper how have you coped how long did it take you to be alright with your decision for my part left 3 5yr hmm maybe just don understand fi very well m pretty new to this could you explain how fi relates to what ve said thanks for your help hello there ve always typed as enfp and d say that overall think the descriptions of enfps suit me well participate on the enfp forum here and by and large relate to lot of the cried about week ago broke up with boyfriend now ex of 3 5 years last july left because convinced myself our relationship problems weren possible to fix they were result of duplicate post drawing energy from people work at large university and there are people everywhere love it when walk into building and people are chatting moving from place to place studying doing think often come off as an enfj at times maybe in part because my mom is one too also think that in the work place my behave more like j just because need to get things done and need m not an istp but dated and istp for 3 5 years and that sounds about right any time would make critical remark about someone let say someone was being really rude at party and we were feel like click with many people that being said the very best of connections that ve had tend to happy with other intuitive types and quite possibly enfps not one bit this exactly do enjoy being dominant in bed sometimes just to change things up need variety more than anything but overall this find istjs hilarious they make the very best funny observations they re excellent at pointing out the glaringly obvious in way that cracks me up so much love for this type oh one more stj thing that love they re super funny has anyone else had an istj friend who makes the best hilarious observations feel like this is definite thing absolutely this seems to be especially the case with people that are very logic bound this may have been asked before if so my apologies there a lot of pages to this thread intjs when you fall in love do you tend to open up emotionally quite bit m dating an intj here a question for you are you sure they hate you or do you just think they do ve struggled with social anxiety too but something ve learned over the years is that more often than not untangled an istps web and then abruptly left him went away for summer internship and realized was really lonely in our relationship because m so emotional and he was only just starting dated an istp for 3 5 years and we got back together twice he ended things begged for him back when broke up with him this last time he wanted to get back together too but it didn work definitely when was little my mom would make me sit on my hands at restaurants lol hi everyone ve seen few threads that have mentioned the maturity of enfps in passing and how maturity age makes such difference in how enfp posters communicate on these forums m totally its satisfying figuring out what the problem was get super interested in all sorts of things and learning about why my baking failed interests me to be sure also hate failing at could be an oddball here but most of my closest friends are stjs dating an stj would probably be terrible and would end up making me feel really misunderstood and them really annoyed and it so interesting when you mention that you get hyper focused do you find that coming from your medication when worked with my therapist we worked on how people with adhd often get ve tried out few medications over the years mostly antidepressants but adhd related stuff was in the mix too personally decided medications we re for me although my adhd presents some hahahaha if by love life you mean when did peak at hookups then the answer is never although m only 24 so who knows tend to get into longterm relationships over hookup scenarios ve hahahahahaha both are exactly examples of what d do overall it sounds like some enfps have got it when it comes to baking other don for those of us that struggle we re too darn hardly watch television every now and then though ll come across series that really enjoy although find that in those scenarios watch all the series online one episode after another m very socialable although as others have mentioned when speaking from their experiences m less interested in talking about myself when socializing and m more interested in finding out about had meltdowns too and you know what the worst part was the fact that they re called meltdowns m an emotional person to be sure but m not an over the top and out of control emotional or my dreams can be really surreal or very realistic the only common trait seems to be that if something isn going my way in dream m usually aware that m dreaming just enough to change my m terrible baker can cook just fine but baking that a whole other story any other enfps out there like this think sometimes lack attention to detail when it comes to definitely connect with nfs best no doubt we always feel like we just get one another and we can open our hearts to one another pretty easily that being said many of my best friends are just had to jump in on this discussion as just broke up with an istp after 3 5 years ended things somewhat abruptly back in july don really know if my love for my ex istp will ever ve been there dated an istp for 3 5 years he was extremely logical and m quite the opposite it lead to lot of hurt on both ends but mostly mine think left the relationship ',\n",

              " ' incredibly quiet outside of my friend groups because everyone else made fun of me or thought was weird for the most part within those friend groups was probably one of the most outgoing and honestly okay see this the kind of thing where context is important it not one size fits all kind of thing coincidentally this is exactly the kind of thing about myself seeing all sides of mean most people will probably narrow it down to sensing types but don think it completely accurate usually have no problem seeing eye to eye with xstps and even more mature xsfjs never understood people who complain about how modern music movies entertainment whatever sucks just ignore and engross yourself in whatever you do like with the internet you can do that think usual tell tale way is how an intp or entp reacts to an idea or brainstorming in general an entp will get carried away really easily and think of all the possibilities first and work out stand by istp with george in that episode where susan parents made him part of that organization for susan he was extremely paranoid that he was being set up somehow when his tape recorder elaine is definitely an extroverted judging dom of some sort m leaning more towards te think george is actually an istp m not exactly your token extrovert usually try and avoid lot of social gatherings even though do enjoy and get energy from people m just very eccentric person especially my tastes so see what you re saying so in an ideal situation for progressing system ti would innovate and te would execute both are important in that sense good god man nothing would ever get done but in all honesty when hear speculation about robots eventually taking over the more automated jobs have to wonder whether society will adapt and see think this is an interesting thing about mbti taking the population statistics with grain of salt they do seem pretty accurate generally ve noticed entjs and intjs are listed as the can confirm am dirty skank honestly see lot of ntps in relationships with sfjs oddly enough don identify with anyone or anything for the most part cliques in general turn me off kind of enjoy being loner as opposed to not if do involve myself in sub culture it very loosely can do it out of necessity mainly from my jobs but have to try and not make it seem too forced if it not an obligatory interaction can have more fun with it and be myself depends who it is someone made thread while ago saying what chess is for ntjs scrabble is for ntps think it pretty accurate ntps love wordplay ehh that seems like more of an nf thing personally never really got anime poke around with typing people and it never really affects how socialize treat everyone the same like if type someone it not like go oh she clearly an isfj she must be boring shit m an intuitive and fucking hate most sciences at least science in the chemistry realm with lot of math love social sciences and biology though agree with all of them except loki think loki is infj bruce banner being intp would make sense since him and stark get along so well esfps are genuinely fun loving people but sometimes they don realize when they re overstepping boundaries they re generally very well liked and popular even if they re not always my personal cup yeah definitely isfp at least with isfjs can usually see where they re coming from as we share the same functions isfjs get lot of hate but find them to be very sweet down to earth people so how you crazy kids meet well mom the thing is oh got this one gather round children once dated girl whom was trolling on ask fm site where you anonymously ask questions and they answer she was loosely affiliated with another are you scandinavian sensors just gonna stand by while these intuitives don let you in on their reindeer games rise up assemble just because people misuse the cognitive function approach in such manner does not invalidate it relevancy you re insinuating that stupid things people say about the theory means the theory better question is do people actually care if there is no scientific validity or even validity among psychologists if you re actually trying to pass mbti off as scientifically valid think interesting personally like to remain neutral on lot of issues as most things aren simply black or white with me and suppose those that are are the very things you say waste my time it figures my perfect match is the rarest type of all definitely agree with your estimation of te my father is by and large pretty unpleasant and always has look of don talk to me around the house but if we have company he all of sudden pretty big one in my opinion which is why get mad when see someone asking whether they re two types that share no functions whatsoever infp and infj intp and intj etc while the ve actually set my life up to revolve around my night owl habits go to bed between 2 4 am and wake up between 10 12 to go to work school depending on the day it glorious man my head is so m definitely thrill seeker and bit of an adrenaline junkie that be shame if he was an enfp rendering his username pointless world of entps would be fun for about 3 days until the dirty dishes start piling up isfj easy esfj enfj some kind of fe dom generally don give shit what look like exercise often but my wardrobe is laughably bland wear the same thing everyday care more about getting along with people than something as that actually reminds me of something remember was dating this girl enfp and while was hanging out with her and her friends one of them was having nervous breakdown while we were all entp best friend is an esfp other close friend is an estj but wait like how can an intuitive be that compatible with sensors herp derp u200b why do you think we would be worse than someone like say an intp or istp in that department types with worse fe than us know personally suck at it because in my case would never allow think everyone agrees adam savage from mythbusters is an entp as in ve literally never seen anyone claim otherwise can think of many others that people have complete certainty in people as an extrovert like online forums quite bit but get restless if m receiving all of my social stimuli from it alone for instance don enjoy it anymore if haven actually socialized interesting how almost everyone except for the intjs in this thread agree to certain extent that the sound of an intj is made very appealing online think lot of you intjs underestimate si is filthy whore honestly don remember truth be told was not in the greatest state of mind was 17 believe looked into it way too much mainly as way to rationalize my own shortcomings fell victim well for while thought was an intp and acted like one from about 15 18 but it was just my ti developing went through very logical nazi phase and questioned everything in my life my so go to community college and often think m missing out on the so called college

that came off as bad for you don mean that parents are the sole reason for why you are as you are or that you need to celebrate them as your hero and what not it just is it that feeling when you look at someone and your heart hurts think felt something similar not long ago but managed to rationalise that it was not meant to be and proceeded to ignore have some of the same issues my only solution is to detach myself when grow up if can become financially independant can move somewhere else and pursue the places in which can be try to rationalise it many times get upset is because other people are acting being negative and in those cases just ignore them but don blame myself if there are situations where okey ve had few thoughts and inspirations that were initially focused on other people

less cutting social changes hit me pretty hard used to be pretty extroverted before first grade had several female friends and then boys and girls kinda got seperated when we started in first grade got the first step is to sleep 8 9 hours day the rest will come after at the moment my fantasies are much more enjoyable than my real life chinese and vietnamese ftw m even afraid to turn 18 death is horrifying sometimes perfect is the opposite of what you thought was perfect in search of becoming better always seem to be directed back to who actually am or who want to be the most aesthetically actually think that with good attitude and sleep patterns can get you very far know ve let myself down with lazyness procrastination and bad habits in general m not sure if believe in thanks everyone watched the ken robinson movie and it is truly inspiring for me think you guys are right ve already set my mind so should go for it 100 think something within hey people am currently at one of the most significant crossroads of my life that being career choice the title sums up the essence of my problem music has always been huge part of about the hormone thing pay attention to the days you re feeling down ve noticed it happens to me around 15 20th every month autumn and winter the seasons for cuddling inside john mayer do you know me playcount 449 hints fail on me because have something called hope you should send him very dirty and sexy message i think that is what would provoke me the most to take contact believe in love and don give damn if you don i probably would ve loved it but it would be so hard to initiate it and opening up am really starting to become the kind of person want to be and myself is the most sacred thing have would never walk away from that for some benefits in life don want to dishonour have cousin who is netting lot of wins in solo would expect hes isxx but am not sure anyway expect he is working on routine and simply succeeds in doing the things according to not lonely actually think our central broke down so all we got is here xd would describe my hidden darkness not as something where there is lot of bad things there is just nothing good there is difference between having had many traumatic experiences leading to the more think the wider my perspective becomes the happiness of my life shrinks in the proportion and to be frank it sucks moment of removing all understanding insight and consequence is there is never way back when you do those acts towards person drugging person will have scarmemory upon himself forever imprisonment there is no way back time goes by time does not live to not live up to the male stereotype it means that won be able to get into relationship with those who won love me for who really am and am totally fine with that never as freak but always out of sync with other people this is truly great speech and great message am glad that there are other people with their eyes open can think that know exactly how am perceived by others but am 100 sure that can never know the full picture others might act when around you they might be nicer than they actually feel have to disagree with many of the posts here don resent your parents despite every bad thing they do towards you they only do it because they love you and want you to grow up am forever usually give warning if you receive one don ignore love happiness truth am clumsy that is why remain calm and cool as much as possible always tell the truth suck at lying but when tell the truth do it with no hesitation so it might look like am lying don really know picking the child would have known that did the right choice it would be much more tougher for me than the child picking the spouse would have ended up scenario with two broken souls i live on being polite except when am with my closest friends then can be littleor very nasty these cocky people see so little compared to humble people one word seinfeld baby dogs are supercute but catgirls are sexy if you really knew me you would know that am sad because of all the people who doesn have the chance enjoy life like myself the fact that the wealthiest keep gathering riches and that the it has to be someone am attracted to but the thing here is that it is not very respectful to take up someones time if you really do not like the person because she deserves someone who likes

its ok dont get it thats fine haha of course they do this is what being creative imaginative is all about thats how love very forceful aggresive act you ll actually be surprised how well it works the things can do with my fingers and tongue would give you an orgasm before im even inside you ever been raped imagine that except you ll love it well tend to have knack at accidentally destroying girls who say that so im sorry if that happens funny you mention that it was actually about an hour ago we broke up long term not working moved from stoke to coventry im not expecting you to know where these are but basically moved hmm im not sure ive always come off as being quite cocky and in the bedroom im very sure of myself definably an istp thing suppose no ones sure at first though but get told im amazing started it coz wanted to confirm my findings to see if it was just myth or whether there was sumthing to it also wanted the opinion of other to form discussion about it which has the next jena jameson right there tbf imagine istp on istp to be quite raw clearly he was the wrong guy come england and ill show you how real istp like all good istp did he bang his head recently thats the istp enfp connection right there in theory you cant resist each other thats where the istp comes in with his her excellent learning capacity ti an istp mind functions on gathering vast store of facts and information and deploying their extensive knowledge when swear thats what we ve been saying this whole thread basically made it more complex im more into the idea of making things simple and keeping things simple thats what do im system in theory its only biased to whoever posts and therefore will be as biased an any survey and it was to keep record of this evidence but the rest you ve lost me im pissed and its 3 30am _ ahh suppose youd have to of been following it from the start but basically the purpose of this thread was to find out how many women feel that istp are good in bed etc and of course positive its ok we re all drunk here btw 7 2 for the 2 one was istp istp sex obvious missmatch there and the other lacked confidence no one without confidence has ever had great sex and is well no one who lacks confidence ends up being good lover but can almost garuntee that if you find confident istp he will rock your world but don take my word for it look what every it is quite wierd how well we pair up with enfp though considering how they do not have the dominant extrovert thinking preference which matches our dominant introvert thinking preference yess you are the best guy ive ever met hahahahaha yh thats the deep realm right there cant talk about that shit though replace finger with your penis and your not too far off really play the one note solo suppose thats pretty intx ish though depends on the situation of the level of analysis e stress on the spot decision the typical istp mind set is usually straight forward logic mines gotta find the right key ant really well id say more like playing musical instrument tbf that threads where its at nowadays dont even lie well yh as your fucking her you can kind of get scale of how well your doing and hence what your doing right or wrong ideally you want her screaming loud and alot and you learn to achieve this as at least your not boring and true istp you are then haha and im in coventry england studying civil engineering know right do live up to the stereotype of an istp engineer or what lol if you could do jena jameson standards yh of course haha and you re at uni as well what you studying where you from what can say other than like it when people say nice things about me also made an amazing thread if you re male istp and managed get sum girls talk dirty yh may aswell be fucking your brother however the most famous female istp is jena jameson do you relate to her on any scale yh send me this thread noo you didnt just rumour that also 6 with no negative comments from female yet and you my friend are fucking legend haha making out french kissing etc of course love it we dont exactly have intimacy issues well not severely and tbh actually like giving it but just because know where it gets me in like any good ti do my research before make any bold statement and why thank you delightful to be part of the community also jus got in from night out im university student and pissed yh but being female its only natural male istp tend to be alot more emotionally reserved no do this sometimes as well like your mind goes off on an odd tangent its ideal for sex though coz it keeps you mind off and you keep constant rhythm ideal for giving girls an orgasm you sure you re an istp yup we call that the istp experience also believe that ones worth 2 points considering its impressiveness however its the same poster from the second point so id stick this on 3 well taking what dustydrill took into account the dominant ti function can give us the motivation to learn about what makes good sex and allow us to be perfectionists at it and again the se actually just realised how arrogent that sounds however ive research and evidence supporting it see this thread we put so much thought into our responses because we are exactly what we say we are on the tin analytical thinkers cool headed problem solvers clearly analysing exactly what it is we want to put from another thread originally posted by tomroberts well istp are the mechanics and are hands on kinaesthetic learners and are bound to be hands on also dont want to go too personal true that istp are perfectionists which is pretty killer in the sack have found myself looking into what is good sex and then putting it to practise until it is near perfection you then learn scratch that it is on topic strong male and good lover are linked in somewhere however discussing it over another guy is starting to get weird these were the results was looking for in support of my arguement we have result 1 in response to this was goin for the strong male ram it in her compliment do not take what perfect answer clearly powerful istp valid statement it could be that sex has nothing to do with personalities however that is one of the purposes of this post furthermore the se isn a slave as such as support to the ',\n",

friend and reflects on how great that relationship was with that friend thought you were joking about that by you don see the ridiculous implications of it all an entp poses as an infj and befriends person as caricature of another person it is the implications of pulling off such con that amused it all makes sense now at this point really have no tangible explanation as to how the original post bothered me wish knew why because it might help am not knowable in that sense personally don find the you re an entp why because of your fondness toward infjs it a different type of fondness than other types exhibit it closer to the fondness one has for their childhood favorite pet nobody get ne vibe from your post but that is just one post the reason say ne has to do with how you are connecting your thoughts also those online tests don do well distinguishing between my salads usually only have romaine or red lettuce if m being adventurous ll add onions carrots eggs and cheese but have that salad maybe six times year otherwise it is just going to whoever said infjs were human ni is quite alien the infj entp thread in the entp forum amused me mostly for its excessive hyperbole think every infj related thread in the entp forum should be stickied if for no other reason than to amuse the personality can also have an impact on this type 4 or an nf is likely going to have different reaction than say type 1 or st by the time my idealistic self recognizes reality in its present communication isn just buzzword the infj can use ni to predict trends and fe to determine what

for some reason refused to use the console codes but would painfully figure out what skills to get to shhh those are trade secrets what cognitive functions cause an infj to be so cautious and second

how they can better improve your dining experience wasn able to navigate much less survive the social environment of high school did alright in college and even better in my masters think it just takes time for everyone to grow up part when was younger struggled with anxiety experience taught me that people were not to be trusted could be intimidated by powerful peers who were self confident or overly aggressive now think it interesting that the infjs make up such significant segment yet have so few posts in their forum it could be that we don post often ve been here while and have only managed think the panda bear fits me very well even think bamboo is fascinating don really have reason why like bamboo think pandas are mysterious yet captivate people they are powerful that sounds like an infj doorslam don know what advice to give you for me that is an extreme solution to problem where there are no other valid options you should read up on the infj door my resolution this year is to be more direct imply lot of things rather than stating them outright and assume everyone else is able to think on the same wavelength as do can be too passive haven heard anything about that interesting was under the impression that things like the steady state theory weren even remote possibilities haven kept up with recent developments but isn redshift on the majority of stellar bodies observed proof of an expanding universe actually cannot think of anything with blueshift right m not completely sure that can actually define what am looking for think it has to do with relying on intuition on regular basis m future minded so if cannot envision even vague ve never had those horror stories but that probably because m cautious and move about as fast as turtle when it comes to dating for me asking someone out is very vulnerable moment and i don like arguments it doesn help that am terrible at them either would rather discuss and learn than argue cannot think of single example where have ever won an argument even m sorry to hear that know some people believe that you can mix with headphones don agree with that completely sometimes that the best option at the time

not find shyness to be factor in my seclusion and detachment simply don talk very to me sex is pollution both for your body and your mind it is one of the driving forces that makes us more creature than angel it disgust me how often it comes up in conversations usually as i find creative trickery very humorous for example just recently was having trouble with fishing rod unable to get it working correctly purchased new one the next day my best friend ask have only heard his music on few occasions from what ve gathered he is fairly humble guy very strong feeling type and an introvert for sure it is hard to tell the rest just from find it quite interesting that you are having this problem in the first place our strong extroverted intuitiveness breeds creativity that combined with our deep introverted feeling and sensing on the internet where people see your type and get to read about your type it is easy to pick faults it all comes down to what you value for example an intj is likely to value logic most 1 what personality types are your parents if you know what was it like as an infp growing up with them as your parents do you relate better to one parent over the other neither or both m actually interested in how having te as your dominant and fi and your inferior affects your life and your outlook on relationships since idealist are the exact opposite all my infp friendships

and the right amount of marek that sounds so lovely proud for me it enneagram think it is because have more to gain from learning about being an enneagram 4 from other 4 than my mbti type can handle being an infj alot easier and don require as don have one yet either lol people around me keep asking me why and just don really need it yet maybe when need it for work or something see young people doing this the most but goldengrass that is one of my favorite visualizations too and your avatar photograph is amazing happy if you can visualize place that calms you and makes you happy what would it look like it would be place that is tranquil vivid and allows you to restore balance these type of exercises are bekkajp consists of mish mash of grasping key things about me my thoughts feelings even if he doesn agree with it and then on top of it accepting and respecting it this is good compare yourself only to who you have been not to everyone else everyone is walking different road in life two reasons 1 to break down the walls that separate me from other people and feel more connected to them on human level that cannot happen if understand them but they don understand me twin2 yes that helped thank you happy and at least from my experience tend to try to think about why am feeling something rather than just accepting feel it it almost like try to hi am happy you figured it all out used to think was intj until saw the light plus your avatar is adorable happy mango kiwi thank you so much like your explanation happy twin2 it ok thank you for trying proud have seen how my enfp thinks aloud too and know it is very difficult to explain what happens inside that is how feel about ni did am here because want to know what fi looks like for an enfp could one of you try to explain it asked my enfp boyfriend about it and he could not say too much because he does not know mbti too how would one be aware an infj loves them you will feel it coming from her you will see it in her eyes when she looks at you she will be vulnerable yet still guarded she will put herself most irritated long days having to engage with alot of people because it is the polite thing to do most annoyed having to listen to shallow and uninteresting conversations but not being used to score as intj all the time then realized ti is pretty high on my list of functions and te was somewhere below it think that te was only showing up on tests because my father is an for the moments when you feel alive want the opportunity to have moments and get swept up by them as they come 1 beautiful dancing or singing mesmerizes me know when it is good because get goosebumps that run all through my body just from observing tango ballet and ballads are some of the most guess will try can you tell me any one secret about yourself like walking barefoot on grass mud and pebbles it feels wonderful and do not care about having to wash my feet hi am not sure if there are many estp on this forum so figured should ask infj instead could really use some advice friend of mine has girlfriend of about 6 months he is an yes have been called intimidating before my friend says that have too many defenses surrounding myself and that it is easy to just look from afar lol he once used castle metaphor and said unless it will affect my relationship with someone care about or it violates one of my principles values always avoid it for example someone cutting in front of me in line is not worth me doing am actually having some problems with an acquaintance of mine that think is an estp female she thinks don like her because am quiet and don comment on what she says any advice would be skewed like italics would say upper right corner like the person above me hate groups but if it has to be done it has to be done observe and listen mainly if someone forces me to interact get nervous but do the minimum hold back alot of myself though yes this is recurring problem of mine writing has really helped me would also recommend finding inspiration watch movies read look at art take walk talk to stranger about it talk to that is because you are usually lying big brother only turn how did you say it harsh when there is no other way to get my point across to you that you are being fake if you were being they are sunshine on stormy days and human piñatas filled with love if you can get them to open up to you happy they are fun loving charming quirky humans who like making people laugh by forgiveness from past mistakes and haircut proud make them laugh somehow it works on me when am getting to an unreasonable point of irrational ranting brooding enfp are especially good at this btw proud creating distraction such as used to be this way though not as bad as you when was in codependent relationship that revolved around the other person however am not codependent anymore these feelings pop up from time don know about other infj but want to know people there is curiosity in me to understand have had people freak out because some of my questions are too deep but don care hi welcome to perc hope you have blast here the infj sub forum is pretty cool proud don confuse feelings with the truth it ruins relationships with people especially because hate conflict and do not give them chance to prove my feelings were wrong my boyfriend is an enfp and always say that he is really good at hiding his intelligence with an armor of random silliness enthusiasm he is really interested in social sciences as well others rarely get bored go inwards and think about things if am unable to leave the situation only time get bored is if am trying to please someone else and don have the nerve to tell them watching an excellent dance gives me unexpected goosebumps too it just so beautiful like shopping for about total of two hours when it involves clothes anymore time and start settling for things just to leave find it somewhat boring and start getting pissed off have not petrichor the smell after rain passionate speakers man playing with child and intellectual banter my brother one year younger is an istp we have awesome conversations about complicated matters but his insight is always direct and short always want to hear how he came to it and he can yes have been accused of talking down to people or making them feel stupid when go overboard and start telling them they are feeling and thinking something they reject wholeheartedly have ',\n",

between two 6 10 m into acting and improv and more recently slam poetry like performing in general actually to be fair though used to be lot more infj as kid and guess some of that stayed my sister is an infj and someone thought she was mute the first three or four months that they knew her because she almost never spoke in public yeah it probably just him crackfic is just why fluff is disgustingly happy and also boring entj reminds me of the name of someone know in real life enfp text talk if you re on your phone and you need to send quick message it okay in small doses however if you re on the computer is it really that hard don read much fanfiction but when do it mostly adventure or action based with the occasional more drama filled au in terms of watching things it usually action adventure comedy infj then inxj and now intj it was pretty gradual process from the second to third though hey there welcome to percafe hope you find what you re looking for here hey there m an intj as well can completely relate to your experiences with the mbti and hope that you find what you re looking for here passively guess it usually more along the lines of oh these two characters suit each other and or have the potential to be in relationship and it pretty much ends there totally missed it when you got it dang but congrats d probably want to go somewhere relatively quiet maybe cabin in the woods or something ve never really considered the possibility of marriage since m not usually into well people in wouldn say that we e intjs would get upset but blanking out is definite possibly don be overemotional on purpose but if that what happens just let it be he should still yeah two sisters five and nine years younger respectively infj and suspected infp if that counts for anything for reference sake ll call them and instead of the older one and the think that started to realise it when was six when was given extra language arts e english but with fancier name homework that involved classic novels instead of the picture books like chess and was pretty good at it as kid but don know about now on the other hand enjoy scrabble more but seem to lose lot because almost all the people know that actually don own car and hate transit so walk almost everywhere need to go also snowboard sometimes during said season which is usually from late november to mid april where live hey chi welcome to percafe the thing about this site is that it relatively easy to find like minded people around so m sure that looking in your type forum will help or at least help you get still in high school but at least m almost done don know how helpful can be but my father is an istj and both my sister and mother are infjs so ve seen lot of related interactions first hand body language is ridiculously important both my sister and mother are infjs and it was extraordinarily easy to type my mother but typing my sister correctly took some time for while thought she was an infp but after reviewing the oh hi barracudachu and eh that okay you re different person and therefore different from what m used to to be able to talk to other people about mbti related topics without getting blank

emphasize with you and m sorry for ever hurting you certainly didn mean to didn even know you felt that way don think it an unforgivable offence but if we are going to work can really take vacation right now believe me ve thought about running home to mom he just communicated to me that he has been really unhappy for really long time he said when he would am certainly trying to be strong there has been crying lot of crying and soul searching am really hurt can even wrap my mind around the fact that there is another woman even if they he text me this morning m sorry kept all that from you by the time it developed into what it did just didn know hwo to explain it don know why feel the need to be so secretive it did not go well asked him to be honest with me and he said okay asked him what was going on and he saying nothing he just lied and lied and lied until showed him the hard cold facts that thank you all for the advice and the prayers hope he admits his betrayal regardless of the depth m going to try really really try to talk to him in calm manner give him the option the be ve never had problem with him having female friends ever have male friends have found out that he has been talking to her for over year and several hours week tons of text and picture 1 why are we together 2 do we want to stay together 3 why do we want to stay together 4 what will our lives look like in 5 years if we stay together m going to do this need cinnamon83 so now ve taken the enneagram test and scored 3 it said that often people in leadership or management me score an 8 but are really 3 the achiever so tried to compare the 3 there is certainly emotional issues as discussed multiple times on the thread again he is not showing any signs of depression although he is stressed out with work he is still touchy feely told him two weeks ago that if we wanted out now was the time he doesn want out he isn showing signs of depression ve let him be several time over the past 15 months but don know you are correct and can sum that all up in one word communication sorry that came out wrong what meant to say is we have identified which love language we each need know he seeks quality time like you mentioned he also likes gift so pick him up little spoken like true entp this is what would have asked too yes there was pressure to get married and he even admitted to having commitment issues from his father leaving his family when he was have read it and we do have different love languages think we both fulfill most of them just not the physical one besides cuddling alles_paletti it not unfixable probably but you need to restore trust the question is not what should you do but what should you stop doing and what you should stop doing is trying to m not fat m tiny if that was the problem could fix it figured that question out sensitive doers are isfp and that fits him but so does the istp the individualistic doer could he be both individualistic doers are self assured and very cinnamon83 don know enough about all of this but can an istp be the the sensitive doer sensitive doers are gentle modest and reserved persons they cope well with everyday life and like well he is kind of an odd ball the artist fits him in lot of ways this is guy who called himself hippie and conservative at the same time he procrastinates all the time and has been it does look like threw up all over it wasn my fault promise redhotpengy the description found did and he would point that out but regardless cinnamon83 you may disagree with this okay go with me on this windmill slam this may be up your ally think he actually may be isfp good bit more so than istp although he would disagree and say m not sensitive think figured out part of what he doesn like about me wow cross posted estj relationships the estj is outspoken person of principles which are readily and directly think figured out part of what he doesn like about me wow estj relationships the estj is outspoken person of principles which are readily and directly expressed estjs are not agree and have that is why he is seeking professional help it blows my mind though that he won even try anymore he isn selfish so can fathom why he doesn want to at least try and or text canislycaon he would hate that and tell me m not 50 shades of gray you sort of lost me on this am not flirting with other men now and wouldn do that to intentionally try to make him jealous was totally kidding about being kidnapped ha if wasn a estj would do just that m workaholic so it kind of like m not here lot does that count and never commanded that he see shrink that was his idea canislycaon bahahaha love it actually thought of this the other day but don know if he would go for it roll play date night go to the bar and tell him to meet me there and hit on windmill slam wow thank you for all of that agree with you that he has developed and also think he borders and i like istj strengths and weaknesses 16personalities too it very

true but it doesn help me fix the sex thing m only 30 and want to have sex with my husband it not crazy thought it not just the act of sex but the ik3 thank you for that do want it to work and that is why joined the group since he and his therapist think we may have personality conflict thought what better place to seek advice also you never answered my previous suggestion has he been tested for low testosterone levels that would ve been my first guess as to why someone would suddenly stop being interested in sex with perhaps don think so though looked into the socionics and think you may be

myself in shape watch my calories and keep them at 2000 eat whatever want but in moderation take long walks yeah that an intp trait lot of people on here can probably understand there are times when read book that m not interested in and don finish it finish book when am somewhat although can handle yes or no answers score borderline though know how that is worked at wendy last summer and all the girls younger than me didn like me in fact was hated there by group of girls there was of course decent people there that first of all congrats on finding an intj lady you were wondering why you wanted relationship since you haven been in one for three years even introverts want relationships sometimes even thought it was funny that you typed in hate feelings into google go to the animal store just to meet new cats once week my mom won let me have one when get out on my own the first thing will do is buy cat yeah that what was thinking really like that description had both like what explained before score in between and when was anorexic was exactly like what you described in the past 4 years ve have lot of the traits of an overt schizoid interesting don think there is anything wrong with me though no we exist but m trying to figure out if you re joking or for real when was younger would never smile in pictures d say smile in lot of my pictures but not all of them my smiles are fake force myself to smile other times don smile but that i often feel like the odd woman out m an intp who is bordering intj go with intp because think that am slightly more intp than intj although do have intj tendencies 1 look m taking general organic and biochemistry class right now fridays are our lab days too am pleasantly surprised as to how like the labs normally just like learning the material through when was in first grade had an obsession with dinosaurs and would read every book had on them when was in sixth grade was trying to teach myself spanish french and german learned i don like to drink guess m the only one but don really care tried drinking and didn think it was fun so not all nts like to drink d wish for for millions of dollars at least m honest then would be able to travel the world and not have to worry about paying for the rest of my education haven been to the doctors in year and half almost don get sick very often so don have reason to go when do get minor sickness just stay home and deal with it on my own back in 2007 used to write really emo blogs about how didn belong in the world and how hated myself and who was however didn shed tear blogs have always been helpful this is from blogthings um m not very outgoing as you see score an i do enjoy being unique and creative do often mask my feelings with my wit overall it okay am not artistic took art history spring semester last year liked learning about the history of how art came to be remember seeing somewhere that cs lewis was an intj he wrote the chronicles of narnia don know if that is true but that what saw all the nts are supposed to be creative because of don drink so can really say how am like drunk it a personal choice of mine don dumb myself down if man guy boy doesn want smart woman then he extremely insecure and unworthy of my time besides have my guard up around everyone not just guys because actually my mom has paranoid schizophrenia and she an infp social interaction is okay every once in while but it drains me and makes me feel awkward feel at ease when am with people ve known for years but have my guard up when am around new don want to admit this but at least this is online and am not the only one yes have imagined that there were people with me and was talking to them do it few times week if not think if the right people get together intj and esfj might work out however if you get two other people with the same types they might get on each other nerves you two seem like good emotionally detached hermits haha my sister told me couple weeks ago that should live in my own little room and never come out since other people tend to annoy me actually everyone has emotions and the ability to be rational just think some people can keep their minds clearer than others other people react differently and think that emotions should be was never diagnosed with it but when was kid people thought had it my aunt told me she thought had asperger syndrome when was 12 and my mom got mad at her read through the no it isn i had anorexia and m an nt also had bulimia for two and half years until august 2008 having an ed really warps someone thinking that for sure in the past year that ve liked the guy on the video he was intense nope m not down with that shit m agnostic and can put it on my facebook myspace because just don want my family to know sometimes sitting around thinking in the shower is fun isn it do it all the time interesting ideas though am not sure if believe in higher being or not agree with what others said you can use logic in all your arguments know people who are s and they would be pissed if their daughter or even son was raped we have an intro to logic do for the most part many of those careers sound like lot of fun too bad my family would just laugh at me if told them wanted to be an egyptologist when was in 6th grade wanted to ',\n",

unlike most intjs from what ve observed here am not as firmly against lies as whole can respect well performed lie it is when they are poorly executed and held to religiously lies hope for the sake of his mental health that you re misinterpreting what he said declaring logic obsolete is like deciding not to believe in gravity anymore what ridiculous notion logic can be obsolete if it was then nothing would be true and d become nihilist ve definitely had the same experience several people have told me that they were afraid of me before they knew me few of the reasons have identified are 1 don smile much some people 1 no my function has to remain as objective as possible if fail to remain objective then how can make proper decisions and observations 2 not life in general can look at specific judging from my interaction with you and the other posts of yours ve seen think it more accurate to say that human contact avoids you don see the social aspect as horribly crippling practice has yielded some measure of social success for me ve already tried the pessimist thing and it wasn very interesting so ve decided wouldn want to be another type being an intj is too fun laughing anger used to be huge issue for me to say wasn in control would be pretty significant understatement was of course ignorant to this since no one who respected intellectually had cared my eventual goal is to write and publish book currently my writing is mainly mental doodles of books may write also write poetry pretty well it is the primary way that express my fi the think you ll find an absense of small talk on the intj sub forum when we talk it tends to veer into discussion m sure that your other male friends are far more versed in fe than your intj was obviously do not know him but find your interpretation of his attitude toward his daughters to be very in that case your decision to not be in relationship with him sounds like the best you sound higher maintenance meaning just needing more interaction not the negative connotation of the phrase the way you view words is the way he probably viewed outward signs sign is just as easy to fake as words so why would you trust that more if the real issue is lack of trust like you not yes really hate that start project with an idea of finished thing then people start tearing down my foundation when it doesn even look anything like what it will in the end wow that suddenly brings back memories of my disapproving grandparents telling me that was going to one day regret refusing to ask for help don remember how old was probably 8 10 but that is not fair evaluation you were looking for comforting sign that he simply saw no need to show that doesn mean the feeling isn there it means he assumed there was no need to express don know if it is because m 16 and therefore simply lack certain about of life experience but find that can still be impressed m not one to take bunch of useless pictures but that a shame pinkrasputin ve only been here for bit over week but really like the posts of yours that ve seen in the intj forum you always contribute something meaningful to the agree with this assertion to point it ceases to be as wonderful when she gets old enough that the cake is riddled with egg shells not sure that happens to all grandmothers but it was certainly haha yeah that doesn sound like it was thought through particularly well that is hilarious crazy that a good point probably since the people getting married will actually want it and appreciate it the divorce rates will decrease significantly m sure that the number of unwed parents will in the usa you can get married outside church but it is still claimed by the churches to be religious institution because they make this claim they want to be able to say that gays can get in no way am connecting gay marriage to the devaluation of marriage m saying that the direction society is moving is causing devaluation of marriage and that this devaluation is actually oh don worry always welcome debate chose not to argue the incest part although did mentally raise the same concerns you did do however expect it to be legal even if only briefly in today in my ethics philosophy class at my high school usa we were having discussion about marriage as an institution and what is happening to it the discussion had turned to what will be the that is surprisingly like my process of emulating people didn realize that other people did it the primary difference is don mentally put myself in the body of the person m emulating but definitely act differently around different people but always act myself in less comfortable situation in group don know or when m with my family tend to be more closed and d think the opposite would be true intj children can be largely independent far earlier than some other types you just need to present your rules and concepts in reasonable logic based fashion with hispanics it is big cultural thing eating is far more social culturally for them m assuming here that they re mexican so while for someone else your wanting to eat alone can be passed but if you get second then you can give them the same ideas and they ll have intense discussions it really pisses me off when someone decides that they get me and are completely off friend of mine decided that she knew me completely she didn at all hadn even let her past the this thread makes me wish had an enfp friend ll have to keep an eye out now criticize you for being content with yourself rather than attempting to self improve criticize you for having 444 posts alright really have no significant opinion on anti depressants and it has already been argued here by better minds than however will put in my two cents about depression vs grief the best m sure he cares about appearance he just probably doesn value it above several other features you surely have if he taking you in the first place so basically to reiterate what others paranoid moderate schizoid moderate schizotypal moderate antisocial high borderline low histrionic low narcissistic high avoidant low dependent low feeling bit pompous are we was not commenting on your right or lack thereof to judge other people as useless tools not at all what am saying is that it is judgement and decision by you to treat them this way rather last summer my whole family except for me was gone at various events that left me alone with the house for two whole days no interruptions at all friend of mine heard this from someone and was that is an ironically self centered way of looking at it in my experience people who tend to socialize more don necessarily need or even want it to be of value think of it like this oh what lovely thought sadly doubt that would go over well with my teacher ve been fighting all year to keep an in this class so m hardly about to sabotage it crazy you know you re an intj when proving the facts to other people is harder than figuring them out for yourself can even begin to list off the number of times ve had to work backwards from inb4 the prospect of other powers completely derails this thread criticize you for your unwillingness to conform or even pause to consider if your negative features are something to be discontinued oh sorry about your cat my cat zoe is very smart too she used to play fetch with hair bands but that was merely
